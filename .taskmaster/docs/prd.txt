CLARITY Loop Backend - Vertical Slice 1 PRD
===========================================

Project Overview:
Build a production-grade HealthKit wellness platform backend with FastAPI and Google Cloud, focused on getting the first vertical slice working end-to-end.

Core Problem:
Users need to upload health data from iOS/watchOS devices and receive AI-powered insights. Currently we have incomplete implementation - we need to complete the first vertical slice: Health Data Upload & Storage.

Current State:
- Basic FastAPI models and endpoints are stubbed out
- No main application file exists
- No service layer implementation
- No database integration
- No actual end-to-end working flow

Phase 1 Goals (Current Priority):
1. Complete FastAPI application setup with proper main.py entry point
2. Implement missing service layer (health_data_service.py)
3. Implement Firestore storage layer (firestore_client.py)
4. Add proper authentication middleware
5. Create working end-to-end test
6. Deploy to Cloud Run for testing

Technical Requirements:
- FastAPI with async/await patterns
- Google Cloud Firestore for data storage
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Pydantic models for data validation
- HIPAA-compliant logging and error handling
- Cloud Run deployment ready

Success Criteria:
- POST /api/v1/health-data/upload accepts health data and returns processing_id
- Data is validated and stored in Firestore
- Authentication is working
- End-to-end test passes
- Application runs locally and can be deployed to Cloud Run

Implementation Priority:
1. Main application setup (main.py, auth middleware)
2. Service layer implementation
3. Database integration
4. End-to-end testing
5. Deployment configuration
