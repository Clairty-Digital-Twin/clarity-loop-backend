# üîó CLARITY Epic Integration: Future Vision for Psychiatric Digital Twins

## Overview

This document outlines CLARITY's **future integration roadmap** with Epic's clinical ecosystem. Based on Epic's official FHIR capabilities documented at [fhir.epic.com](https://fhir.epic.com/), we've designed a comprehensive integration strategy that could transform mental health care by embedding **objective, continuous psychiatric monitoring** directly into Epic's workflows serving 350+ million patients.

**üö® Implementation Status: PLANNED - Not Yet Built**

This integration represents our development roadmap and contribution opportunities for full-stack developers interested in healthcare interoperability.

## üîå Planned FHIR Integration

### Epic-Compatible Mental Health FHIR Resources

Based on Epic's [official FHIR documentation](https://fhir.epic.com/), we would implement:

**Supported Epic FHIR Resources for Psychiatric Care:**
- `Patient` - Demographics and psychiatric history (Epic: Read, Search, Create)
- `Observation` - Digital biomarkers for sleep, activity, mood indicators (Epic: Read, Search, Create)
- `Condition` - Mental health diagnoses (Epic: Read, Search, Create - Problems)
- `MedicationRequest` - Psychiatric medications (Epic: Read, Search)
- `QuestionnaireResponse` - PHQ-9, GAD-7, mood ratings (Epic: Read, Search, Create)
- `Goal` - Treatment goals and recovery metrics (Epic: Read, Search, Create)
- `CarePlan` - Psychiatric treatment plans (Epic: Read, Search)

### Proposed Continuous Psychiatric Monitoring

        "unit": "%"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üö® Proposed CDS Hooks Integration

Epic supports CDS Hooks for clinical decision support. Our planned implementation would include:

### `patient-depression-risk-alert` (Development Target)

```json
{
  "hook": "patient-view",
  "title": "CLARITY Psychiatric Alert",
  "description": "Depression risk prediction based on continuous digital biomarkers",
  "id": "clarity-depression-alert",
  "prefetch": {
    "patient": "Patient/{{context.patientId}}",
    "conditions": "Condition?patient={{context.patientId}}&category=encounter-diagnosis",
    "medications": "MedicationRequest?patient={{context.patientId}}&status=active"
  }
}
```

**Planned CDS Card Response:**
```json
{
  "cards": [{
    "uuid": "clarity-depression-001",
    "summary": "‚ö†Ô∏è CLARITY Alert: Elevated Depression Risk Detected",
    "detail": "Patient's digital biomarkers indicate increased depression risk:\n‚Ä¢ Sleep efficiency declined 22% over 14 days\n‚Ä¢ Circadian rhythm disruption detected\n\nConsider psychiatric evaluation.",
    "indicator": "warning",
    "source": {
      "label": "CLARITY Psychiatric Digital Twin",
      "url": "https://clarity.ai/evidence/depression-prediction"
    },
    "suggestions": [{
      "label": "Schedule psychiatric evaluation",
      "actions": [{
        "type": "create",
        "description": "Schedule psychiatric follow-up based on digital biomarkers",
        "resource": {
          "resourceType": "Appointment",
          "status": "proposed",
          "serviceType": [{
            "coding": [{
              "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/service-type",
              "code": "394913002",
              "display": "Psychiatry"
            }]
          }]
        }
      }]
    }]
  }]
}
```

## üì± Future SMART on FHIR Apps

- Treatment optimization recommendations

### Planned MyChart Integration

**Patient-Facing Features (Development Target):**
- Personal depression monitoring dashboard
- Sleep health insights
- Treatment progress visualization
- Shared decision-making tools with providers
