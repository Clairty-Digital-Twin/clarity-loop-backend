# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop Real-time Monitoring and Alert System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the real-time monitoring and alert system for patient vital signs and behavioral analytics.
# Details:
1. Design real-time data ingestion pipeline for wearable devices
2. Implement vital signs monitoring algorithms
3. Develop behavioral analytics system for activity pattern analysis
4. Create anomaly detection algorithms for patient behavior
5. Implement crisis detection system with early warning capabilities
6. Develop automated alert system for healthcare providers
7. Create configurable notification system for family/caregivers
8. Implement real-time dashboard for patient monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Test real-time data ingestion with simulated wearable device data
2. Validate vital signs monitoring against known medical standards
3. Evaluate behavioral analytics with sample patient activity data
4. Test anomaly detection with various scenarios
5. Verify crisis detection system with simulated crisis events
6. Conduct end-to-end tests of the alert system
7. Test configurability of the notification system
8. Validate real-time dashboard functionality and performance
