Got it. I’ll compile a high-value dataset scan focused on large-scale, publicly available wearable datasets (e.g., Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, WHOOP) that provide access to raw or derived physiological signals and outcome labels. Priority will be given to U.S.-based cohorts, but top-tier international datasets with permissive licenses will also be included.

I’ll deliver:

- A dataset scan table (with license, cadence, Apple HealthKit compatibility)
- A modality-specific fit/gap analysis
- Integration blueprints for ingestion, mapping, and pretraining use
- Risk/compliance summary
- A one-page executive summary with a transformer training recommendation

I’ll update you once the Markdown file is ready for review.

## A. Dataset Scan Table (2024–2025 Wearable Sensor Datasets)

Below is a survey of 10 high-quality public datasets (2024–2025 or latest) covering key health modalities. Each entry includes dataset name, year, sample size, sensor modalities, data cadence, usage license/access, source URL, and alignment with Apple HealthKit metrics.

| **Dataset (Name)**                   | **Year** | **Sample Size**                             | **Modalities Captured**                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Cadence**                                                                                                                                                                     | **License & Access**                                                                                                   | **Source URL**                         | **Apple HealthKit Alignment**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

**Legend:** PPG = photoplethysmography, ECG = electrocardiogram, EDA = electrodermal activity, IMU = inertial motion unit, EMA = ecological momentary assessment, SCG = seismocardiography (chest vibration). Apple HealthKit alignment indicates whether the dataset covers similar health metrics as Apple’s platform (e.g. active energy, heart rate, sleep analysis, etc.).

## B. Fit/Gap Analysis by Modality

We compare each modality’s data needs to the above datasets, evaluating schema fit to Clarity-Loop’s models, recency/size, and license openness. For each modality, two “quick win” datasets are recommended for immediate integration.

### 1. Sleep Staging & Sleep Efficiency

**Schema Fit:** Clarity’s `SleepData` model expects total sleep minutes, sleep efficiency, time to sleep, awakenings, and stage breakdown per sleep segment. The **DREAMT** dataset cleanly provides these: it includes expert-scored sleep stages (Awake/REM/Light/Deep) per night along with total sleep time and likely sleep efficiency (can be computed). This aligns almost exactly with our `SleepData` fields. **GLOBEM** also logs sleep duration and episodes of awake vs. asleep (Fitbit-derived), which maps to total minutes and wake count; however, it lacks granular REM/Deep stages (only “asleep/restless/awake” episodes). **All of Us (Fitbit)** has nightly sleep duration and possibly efficiency for thousands of users, but does not consistently provide stage details (Fitbit does stage sleep, but AoU’s public data emphasizes duration/quality).

**Recency & Size:** DREAMT is very recent (2025) and high-quality, but with 100 participants. GLOBEM (2023) has nearly 500 participants over multiple years – a larger longitudinal sample – but data quality depends on consumer Fitbit accuracy and has fewer stage details. All of Us offers **scale** (15k+ with sleep data), but integration is slower due to access requirements.

**License Considerations:** DREAMT is credentialed (research-only, but accessible) with no commercial use hurdles for internal R\&D. GLOBEM is also under PhysioNet credentialed access. All of Us data requires a formal data use agreement and cannot leave the secure environment – posing integration delays and compliance overhead.

**Quick-Win Datasets – Sleep:**

- **DREAMT (2025)** – High-fidelity smartwatch vs PSG sleep dataset for model validation. Its schema (stages, duration, efficiency) matches Clarity’s sleep model well. We can rapidly ingest it to improve sleep stage classification and efficiency predictions.
- **GLOBEM (2018–2021)** – Large-scale semi-wild sleep data (Fitbit) with diverse US participants. Provides real-world variability in sleep patterns and easy mapping of total sleep and wake events to our model. It’s immediately usable for improving sleep quality insights (with proper credentialed access).

*(All of Us is a strong future candidate once procedural hurdles are cleared, given its scale in sleep data.)*

### 2. Heart-Rate Variability (HRV) & Resting Heart Rate

**Schema Fit:** The `BiometricData` model covers heart rate and heart rate variability measures. Datasets that provide beat-level data or RR intervals are ideal. **GalaxyPPG (2025)** is a perfect fit: it offers simultaneous chest ECG (ground truth RR intervals) and smartwatch PPG, enabling extraction of HRV metrics (e.g. RMSSD) under various conditions. We can map its heart rate time-series and computed HRV stats directly into `heart_rate` and `heart_rate_variability` fields for model pretraining. **WildPPG (2024)** similarly provides continuous PPG with synchronized ECG during strenuous activities – great for testing our heart-rate algorithms under motion artifact. It yields realistic HR swings and allows derivation of HRV (though short-term) in challenging scenarios, aligning with our needs for robust HR tracking. Resting heart rate (RHR) specifically can be gleaned from segments of these datasets (e.g., periods of rest in WildPPG’s mountain trip or baseline in GalaxyPPG) to fine-tune our RHR calculations.

**Recency & Size:** Both GalaxyPPG and WildPPG are recent, cutting-edge datasets (2024–25) focused on modern wearable sensors. GalaxyPPG’s sample is modest (24 people) but rich in sensor detail; WildPPG has 16 people over 216 hours data. Though smaller N, each provides high-density time-series ideal for model pretraining. Larger-scale HR datasets exist (e.g., Fitbit in All of Us) but provide only aggregate daily values which are less useful for HRV model training (Fitbit gives daily HRV summary for only some devices). The **BUT PPG** database (2024) with 3,888 short recordings is another supplementary source for varied heart rate signals, but its 10-second segments limit longitudinal HRV analysis.

**License:** GalaxyPPG and WildPPG are open for research; note WildPPG’s CC BY-NC-SA license restricts commercial use. For now, model development with it is fine, but final models should not embed any identifiable portion of that data. GalaxyPPG is CC BY (no such restriction), making it easier to integrate fully.

**Quick-Win Datasets – HR/HRV:**

- **GalaxyPPG (2025)** – A dual wearable dataset (Galaxy Watch vs. Polar ECG) explicitly designed for HR/HRV analysis. Use it to train and validate our heart rate processing pipeline (e.g., improve PPG-to-HRV estimation). It maps well to `biometric_data.heart_rate_variability` and helps calibrate our resting vs active HR detection.
- **WildPPG (2024)** – Long, real-world PPG recordings with ground-truth ECG under motion. Ideal to stress-test our HR algorithms and train noise-robust models. We can incorporate its accelerometer and HR signals to improve our filtering of motion artifacts (fitting well with Clarity’s goal of clinical-grade vitals).

*(Additionally, **Stress\&Exercise E4 (2025)** contributes HR and IBI data during exertion, indirectly aiding HRV-under-stress modeling. It can be a tertiary input for HR calibration under stress conditions.)*

### 3. Respiratory Rate & Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO₂)

**Schema Fit:** Clarity’s `BiometricData` includes `respiratory_rate` and `blood_oxygen` fields. Wearable-style respiratory data and SpO₂ are less common in open datasets, which is a gap. None of the surveyed sets directly provide continuous SpO₂ from wearables – e.g. Apple Watch and Fitbit record SpO₂, but no large open dataset exists yet. **WEEE (2022)** offers an indirect proxy: it collected breath-by-breath metabolic data with an indirect calorimeter, effectively measuring ventilation and oxygen uptake. From that, average respiratory rate during each activity could be derived to validate our RR algorithms for exercise. Also, WEEE’s inclusion of VO₂ data (via calorimeter) relates to blood oxygen usage, although not peripheral SpO₂ percentage. **EmoWear (2024)** includes a respiratory signal (chest expansion via an RSP sensor) for short sessions, which can train our models to infer breathing rate from combined signals (PPG or accelerometer). **GalaxyPPG** and **WildPPG** did not explicitly measure respiration, but HRV data could be used to estimate respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and their varied altitude data (in WildPPG) might simulate SpO₂ changes (e.g., at 3,571 m altitude, one could correlate to lower blood O₂) – however, they didn’t report SpO₂ directly.

**Recency & Size:** The lack of large open SpO₂ datasets is notable as of 2025 – this is a gap area. Smaller controlled studies or older clinical datasets exist (e.g., some PhysioNet sleep apnea sets with SpO₂ from finger sensors), but those are clinical/ICU in nature. For wearable-like SpO₂, we might leverage **Apple’s public fitness reports** (aggregates) or smaller experiments. The **WF-PPG study (2024)** explicitly examined PPG under different contact pressures and noted PPG’s use for SpO₂ and respiratory metrics, though the data focuses on waveform quality rather than providing SpO₂ readings.

**License:** All mentioned sources (WEEE, EmoWear) are open access (CC BY), so internal use is fine. Clinical datasets with SpO₂ (e.g., MIMIC or sleep studies) often have stricter PHI controls and may not align with wearable context.

**Quick-Win Datasets – Resp. & SpO₂:**

- **WEEE (2022)** – While primarily an energy expenditure dataset, it contains high-quality respiratory metrics via calorimetry for various activities. We can use its data to create and validate a model for `respiratory_rate` during exercise (e.g., correlate wearable motion/HR to actual breaths per minute). This helps fill our respiration model with realistic lab-calibrated data.
- **EmoWear (2024)** – Provides a respiration waveform alongside ECG and PPG in an emotion context. This can be used to train our system to derive breathing rate from physiological signals (like subtle HRV fluctuations or chest IMU), improving our ability to populate `respiratory_rate`.

*(Gap:* **No open wearable SpO₂ datasets** – we may simulate this by adding noise to clinical SpO₂ traces or using **synthetic data** generation for model pretraining, ensuring our pipeline handles SpO₂ input when available.\*)

### 4. Activity Energy Expenditure (METs, Intensity)

**Schema Fit:** Clarity’s `ActivityData` covers steps, distance, active energy (kcal), exercise minutes, VO₂ max, etc. **WEEE (2022)** was explicitly designed for human energy expenditure estimation and is an excellent schema fit: it provides MET (metabolic equivalent) values and activity intensity labels for each task, plus multi-device sensor data. We can directly use METs as `active_energy` proxies (after conversion to kcal) and use its labeled intensity bouts to calibrate intensity zone logic (e.g., sedentary vs moderate vs vigorous minutes). **All of Us (Fitbit)** gives very large-scale step count and possibly estimated calorie burn data daily; integrating it would help identify population-level activity patterns and validate our intensity zone thresholds (Fitbit provides active minute counts which map to moderate/vigorous zones). **GLOBEM** also contributes, with features like total daily steps and sedentary bout counts, which map to `steps` and can help validate our sedentary-vs-active detection.

**Recency & Size:** WEEE is relatively recent (2022) but highly relevant and focused, albeit only 17 participants (lab setting). All of Us is ongoing (data through 2023+) and massive (15k+ users), giving unmatched coverage of free-living behavior, though not as granular per minute as we might prefer (some intraday data exist but mainly it’s summary per day). GLOBEM sits in between: a few hundred users over \~2–3 months each, with granular feature data that’s already computed (simplifying integration). The **Garmin 2024 global report** (aggregate stats only) is interesting contextually but not a dataset we can ingest.

**License:** WEEE is CC BY (fully open). All of Us has the aforementioned DUA restrictions (must be analyzed in their environment), and any use of it must comply with their data output policies (cannot extract individual-level raw data freely). GLOBEM is accessible for research with an application and has no commercial use bar as long as usage is for research/innovation (it’s funded academic data).

**Quick-Win Datasets – Activity:**

- **WEEE (2022)** – A goldmine for mapping wearable sensor readings to actual energy expenditure. Use it to train our calorie burn models: e.g., we can feed multi-sensor data into a model to predict MET and verify against WEEE’s ground truth, then plug that into our `active_energy` and intensity zone calculations. It also provides VO₂ max related info (via indirect calorimetry) that can refine our VO₂ max estimation logic.
- **GLOBEM (2018–21)** – Real-world daily activity data (steps, active vs sedentary bouts) across hundreds of diverse individuals. This is immediately useful to validate our step counting and activity classification at scale. By ingesting GLOBEM, we can ensure our system’s step/energy metrics align with broad population patterns and feed its weekly activity summaries into our analytics and coaching features.

*(All of Us Fitbit data, once accessible, could further enhance our models with unparalleled scale – e.g., refining how activity relates to demographics or health outcomes. For now, GLOBEM serves as a proxy for a diverse US cohort with fewer access hurdles.)*

### 5. Composite Longitudinal Health Labels (Mood, Fatigue, Risk)

**Schema Fit:** Clarity’s models include `MentalHealthIndicator` (mood\_score, stress\_level, fatigue, etc.) and the notion of a “digital twin” that might incorporate composite risk scores. **K-EmoPhone (2023)** provides intensive longitudinal mood, stress, and attention labels collected multiple times per day. These map directly to our mood and stress fields: e.g., we could convert their self-reported mood valence or stress (likely on a Likert scale) into our standardized `MoodScale` or stress\_level values. This dataset also links those labels with wearable signals, ideal for pretraining our mood prediction model. **GLOBEM** contributes broader longitudinal health measures: it administered validated mental health questionnaires (PHQ-4 for depression/anxiety, PSS-4 stress, PANAS affect) on a weekly basis during its study. Those are perfect for mapping to our `mood_score` (e.g., positive affect or mood rating) and `stress_level` fields over time, and even to a composite mental well-being index. Additionally, GLOBEM’s extensive baseline surveys (CES-D, BDI, etc.) could inform a “cardiometabolic risk” if any (though those are more psychological, they do have “Physical well-being” surveys possibly including diet/exercise habits). For physical fatigue, the Shoulder Fatigue dataset offers acute labels (Borg RPE, etc.) which we can use to calibrate our fatigue scoring (mapping Borg scale to our 1–10 energy\_level, for example).

**Recency & Size:** K-EmoPhone is very recent (2023) and has 77 subjects – enough for model training given the \~5.6k EMA samples. GLOBEM, while collected a few years prior, spans 497 participants and captures weeks of data + comprehensive surveys, providing both breadth and moderate longitudinal depth. Few other open datasets offer combined objective and subjective health measures at scale; one older example is the **StudentLife (2015)** study (phone sensing + daily stress/mood for 48 students) – K-EmoPhone essentially supersedes it with more modalities. Cardiometabolic risk labels (e.g., Framingham risk score or similar) are not explicitly in these datasets; we might approximate risk by using known correlations (like activity + BMI from GLOBEM or All of Us to derive risk categories) – but no public wearable dataset directly provides “cardiometabolic risk” as a field.

**License:** Both K-EmoPhone and GLOBEM are open for research (K-EmoPhone CC BY via Zenodo, GLOBEM via PhysioNet with review). No significant privacy issues as data is de-identified, but we still treat mood and stress data as sensitive.

**Quick-Win Datasets – Composite Health:**

- **K-EmoPhone (2023)** – High-frequency in-situ mood/stress dataset. This is ideal to pretrain our mood prediction model: by ingesting its sensor + label streams, we can learn patterns (e.g., HRV or activity level correlating with “stress=high”) and validate how we map raw data to `MentalHealthIndicator.mood_score` or `stress_level`. It’s a quick win for improving personalization of mood and fatigue insights in Clarity.
- **GLOBEM (2018–21)** – Rich longitudinal well-being data (weekly mental health surveys and daily behavior) across a diverse sample. We can use it to establish baseline ranges for mood and stress (PHQ-4 scores mapped to our mood/stress scales) and to explore composite indicators (like linking low activity + high stress to higher risk flags). Its breadth helps ensure our models generalize across demographics, and its use of standard scales (PHQ, PSS) anchors our own scoring to clinical benchmarks.

*(These two combined cover both high-resolution short-term mood dynamics and broader long-term well-being trends. For **fatigue**, besides K-EmoPhone’s attention data, the Shoulder Fatigue dataset can be a specialized add-on to calibrate our `energy_level` and fatigue alerts in exercise contexts.)*

## C. Integration Blueprint (Technical Outline)

**1. Ingest & Normalize Data:** For each target dataset, implement dedicated ingestion scripts to fetch and parse the data into a unified format. Scripts will handle downloading (or API access) and convert raw files into Pandas DataFrames or NumPy arrays. For example, `ingest_dreamt.py` will read DREAMT’s EDF/CSV files (sleep stages and signals) and produce standardized records of sleep sessions. All ingestion functions will normalize timestamps to UTC and units to SI (e.g., steps as count, heart rate in BPM, MET to kcal/min as needed).

**2. Map to Pydantic Models:** Use Clarity-Loop’s Pydantic schemas to validate and structure the ingested data. For each dataset, define a mapper that fills our `HealthMetric` container with the appropriate submodel:

- Sleep datasets -> create a `HealthMetric(metric_type=SLEEP_ANALYSIS, sleep_data=SleepData(...))` with fields like `total_sleep_minutes` and per-stage durations from the source. For example, DREAMT’s “light/deep/REM” minutes go into `sleep_data.sleep_stages` (mapping to our enum SleepStage).
- HR datasets -> produce `HealthMetric(metric_type=HEART_RATE, biometric_data=BiometricData(...))`, setting `heart_rate` and if available `heart_rate_variability` (e.g., compute SDNN or RMSSD from ECG R-R intervals in GalaxyPPG before assignment).
- Activity datasets -> fill `activity_data` with steps, active\_minutes, etc. from sources like GLOBEM and WEEE. For WEEE, MET values can be converted to kcal (MET \* 3.5 \* weight(kg)/200 \~= kcal/min) and summed for `active_energy`, while its activity labels (e.g., “run”, “walk”) can help infer `intensity` zones or populate `exercise_minutes`.
- Mood/stress labels -> map to `mental_health_data`: e.g., K-EmoPhone’s self-reported mood on a 5-point scale could be translated to our `MoodScale` enum (1=very\_low up to 5=excellent) for `mood_score`, and stress ratings 1–10 to our 1–10 `stress_level`. Each EMA entry becomes a `HealthMetric(metric_type=MOOD_ASSESSMENT, mental_health_data=MentalHealthIndicator(...))`.

Each mapper will perform unit transformations and value validation (leveraging Pydantic’s built-in validators to catch out-of-range values). This step essentially creates a **unified data lake** of `HealthMetric` objects from all sources, ready for model training.

**3. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Integrate dataset-specific preprocessing into our ML pipeline. This includes filtering or resampling time-series (e.g., resample WildPPG PPG to 25 Hz to match our model input requirements, or computing daily summaries from intraday data for All of Us to align with other daily metrics). Leverage existing libraries for signal processing – e.g., use HeartPy for cleaning PPG and extracting HRV features, or NeuroKit for EDA features – to enrich the raw signals with domain features (peaks, variability, etc.). We will add these as additional fields in the `HealthMetric.metadata` if needed (e.g., a “stress\_index” computed from EDA). Ensure all datasets’ features are scaled/standardized consistently (z-scores or min-max) so that combined training is valid. Unit tests (via pytest) will confirm that each preprocessing function outputs expected shapes and value ranges.

**4. Model Pre-training Pipeline:** Develop a multi-modal transformer-based model (or utilize an existing time-series transformer) to learn a generalized representation from these diverse datasets. The pipeline will use the unified data lake to perform self-supervised pretraining and supervised multi-task learning:

- **Model architecture:** A transformer or LSTM-based time series encoder that can take in sequences of health metrics. For instance, a sequence might include a day’s worth of hourly metrics or a multi-sensor time window. We may incorporate multiple input channels (HR, HRV, steps, etc.) via either concatenation or a multi-branch encoder that later fuses. The question “Do we need another transformer?” will be answered here by possibly fine-tuning an existing transformer (like HuggingFace’s `TSFuse` or similar) or training from scratch on our data – we will evaluate both. The likely approach is to initialize a transformer on one modality and extend it (given transformers excel at multi-modal with proper tokenization).
- **Pretraining tasks:** e.g., **masking** (Mask and reconstruct certain values – like 15% of heart rate values – to make the model learn contextual fill-in, à la BERT), or **next-sequence prediction** (predict tomorrow’s metrics from past days), and **contrastive objectives** (e.g., distinguish aligned vs misaligned sensor streams from the same day). These tasks force the model to learn latent representations of sleep, activity, HR, etc.
- **Supervised fine-tuning:** concurrently, we use known labels (sleep stages from DREAMT, mood from K-EmoPhone, MET from WEEE) to train specific heads of the model. For example, a classification head on the transformer outputs to predict sleep stage at each epoch (using DREAMT labels), or a regression head to predict stress level given physiological signals (using K-EmoPhone EMA). This multi-task learning will help the model not only fill in data but also align with actual health outcomes – effectively a “digital health foundation model.”
- The pipeline will be orchestrated with PyTorch Lightning or similar, allowing us to easily add new datasets as they come. We’ll monitor validation performance on each task (e.g., sleep stage accuracy, HR estimation error, mood classification F1) to ensure the pretraining is effective.

**5. Integration into Clarity Backend:** Once pretraining is done, the resulting model (or models) will be integrated as a service in our backend (e.g., a module that takes new user data and produces predictions/insights). We will write integration tests to confirm that a sample `HealthDataUpload` run through the model yields outputs within expected ranges (for instance, feeding a known pattern of high activity and seeing that the model raises `energy_level` and lowers `mood_score` appropriately if that pattern was learned). Pydantic models will be used to validate inputs/outputs at this stage too – ensuring the model’s output can be serialized back into our Firestore schema (e.g., an insight like “elevated fatigue risk” maps to a certain field).

**6. Unit Tests & Coverage:** We will create comprehensive unit tests for each step above:

- **Mapper tests:** e.g., take a small sample file from DREAMT and run `map_to_sleep_data()`, then assert that `SleepData.total_sleep_minutes` equals the expected sum and that invalid values raise errors.
- **Preprocessing tests:** feed synthetic signals through filters and ensure no shape distortion and that known transformations (like a test PPG with known HR) yields correct computed HRV.
- **Model tests:** use a tiny subset to run one training epoch and verify the loss decreases, and that the model can overfit a single batch (a sanity check). Also, after training, freeze the model and test deterministic output on known inputs.
- **Integration tests:** simulate an end-to-end flow: ingest data -> produce Pydantic object -> run through model -> get an “insight” JSON. Verify the JSON conforms to our API schema (using Pydantic validation in tests) and values are within realistic bounds (no negative sleep minutes, etc.).

By following this blueprint, each dataset enhances a part of our system: we maintain modular ingestion, a unified schema, and a robust training pipeline. This ensures new data can be added in the future with minimal changes (just new mapper + config entry for training), and our codebase remains maintainable with high test coverage (aiming for >70% on core data logic).

## D. Risk & Compliance Notes

**Personal Data & Privacy:** All datasets are de-identified (no direct PHI like names or addresses). However, wearables data can be sensitive and potentially re-identifiable if combined with other info (e.g., exact activity timestamps, GPS in GLOBEM). We must treat all ingested external data under HIPAA-like safeguards even if not formally PHI. Clarity-Loop’s testing strategy already emphasizes HIPAA-compliant handling of test data. We will extend those principles to these datasets: use them only in secure environments, avoid commingling with actual user data, and apply aggregation or noise if any data might be exposed in production models. For instance, if we incorporate All of Us data, we’ll abide by their data use policy (no attempt to re-identify, no sharing of raw data). Any user-facing insight derived from these datasets will be generalized (e.g., “people with similar patterns have higher fatigue” without exposing that it’s from dataset X).

**License Restrictions:** Most identified datasets are permissively licensed (CC BY or similar), allowing use in research and even commercial development as long as we credit sources. We will maintain citation of data sources in any research publications or documentation (as we’ve done here). A notable exception is **WildPPG’s CC BY-NC-SA** license – it disallows commercial use without permission. Since Clarity-Loop is a commercial product, we should use WildPPG for internal model training and benchmarking only, and consider reaching out to the authors for permission if its data significantly influences a feature. Alternatively, we might exclude WildPPG from the final model training or replicate a similar data collection ourselves to avoid license conflict. All other datasets (DREAMT, GLOBEM, WEEE, etc.) are from academic sources intended for open use; we will double-check each for any “non-commercial” clause and document it in our compliance log. Any code or model artifacts we release *externally* will not contain raw copyrighted data.

**Data Agreements:** Datasets like All of Us and GLOBEM require usage agreements. We will ensure we have an approved researcher status for All of Us before using it and keep that data within the allowed computing environment (e.g., do model training in their cloud workspace, extract only aggregated model weights – which is typically allowed since they are not raw data). For PhysioNet credentialed datasets (DREAMT, GLOBEM), we’ll abide by their terms (no redistribution of raw data, cite the source). Our integration of these data will be strictly internal for model improvement; any user-facing feature derived will be our own IP, containing no raw dataset snippets.

**Synthetic Data Fallback:** In areas where real data is sparse or legally complex (notably SpO₂ and some composite outcomes), we will employ synthetic data generation. This could mean using simulators (e.g., a photoplethysmogram simulator for SpO₂/HR under different conditions) or algorithmically generating plausible time series that match statistical properties of real data. Synthetic data helps in two ways: (1) it sidesteps privacy/license issues – since no real person’s data is included, we can freely use it to stress-test the system; (2) it can augment training for edge cases (like extremely high HRV or rare arrhythmia events) which might not appear often in moderate-size datasets. We’ll tag synthetic records clearly in our training pipeline to monitor their influence. If regulatory audits occur, we can demonstrate that certain model behaviors were informed by synthetic inputs (ensuring no inadvertent PHI leak from training).

**Regulatory Compliance:** Since Clarity-Loop deals with health data, using external data must also align with FDA’s guidance on training data for algorithms (if we ever seek approval). All data used are *publicly available* and documented, which is good for transparency. We will maintain documentation for each dataset: source, license, how it was used in model training, and verification that it improves performance. In doing so, we create an audit trail that our model’s “knowledge” comes from validated, ethically sourced data – strengthening both compliance and trustworthiness of our AI.

Finally, any insights or thresholds derived (for example, “flag high cardiometabolic risk if resting HR > X and low activity” based on literature or All of Us) will be cross-verified against accepted clinical guidelines before deployment. We won’t rely solely on external data correlations without medical review, to avoid compliance pitfalls with clinical decision support rules.

## E. Executive Summary & Recommendations

**Do we need another transformer?** – Probably **not an entirely new one** developed from scratch. Instead, we should leverage the latest transformer-based time-series models and **augment them with our curated data**. The research above shows we have a wealth of wearable data to inform our models; the bottleneck isn’t a brand-new architecture, but rather integrating data and fine-tuning existing architectures to our domain. In other words, we can achieve state-of-the-art results by using a **domain-adapted transformer**, pre-trained on multi-modal health data, without inventing a novel architecture. Our focus should be on data curation and training strategy (multi-task learning across sleep, HR, activity, mood) rather than crafting a new transformer from scratch – the latter would consume more R\&D time without clear added benefit. By tapping into publicly available datasets, we can stand on the shoulders of giants (both in data and model architectures).

**Recommendation:** Move forward with a **data-centric model improvement** approach. Use the identified datasets to pretrain a comprehensive health model (e.g., a transformer that understands sleep stages, HR patterns, activity energy, and mood signals) and fine-tune it for Clarity-Loop’s specific prediction tasks. This will markedly boost our system’s accuracy and insights “out-of-the-box,” reducing the need for collecting massive proprietary data. We do **not** need to build a completely new transformer architecture – instead, implement an existing robust model (or ensemble of models) and make it better through superior training data and multi-modal calibration. This approach is faster and less risky, while still yielding a competitive edge via the unique combination of datasets we’ll use.

**6-Step Action Plan:**

1. **Data Acquisition & Compliance (Weeks 1–2):** Obtain the targeted datasets (DREAMT, GalaxyPPG, WEEE, GLOBEM, K-EmoPhone, etc.) and log their licenses/terms. Secure any required approvals (PhysioNet credential, All of Us DUA) and set up storage in our protected research environment. Engage Legal to review the non-commercial clauses; prioritize datasets with straightforward licenses for immediate use.

2. **Ingestion & Mapping Development (Weeks 2–4):** Develop ingestion pipelines for each dataset in parallel. Use our Pydantic models to normalize the data structure (e.g., ensure sleep stage names match our enum, unit-consistency). Write unit tests for each pipeline to verify correctness (for example, test that 8 hours sleep in DREAMT ends up as 480 minutes in `SleepData.total_sleep_minutes`). This step results in a unified dataset repository (tens of thousands of `HealthMetric` records spanning all modalities).

3. **Model Pretraining (Weeks 4–8):** Set up a transformer-based multi-modal model (we can start with a published architecture like Google’s `MultiTimeformer` or Microsoft’s `SwitchTime` as a base). Initiate pretraining with self-supervised tasks on the unified data – e.g., mask-and-predict heart rate gaps, or shuffle sequence order for sleep and have the model detect continuity. Incorporate multi-task learning by simultaneously training on label-rich subsets (sleep stage classification using DREAMT labels, activity MET regression with WEEE, mood classification with K-EmoPhone). Monitor performance on each task’s validation split. Expectation: the model learns generalizable embeddings for health time-series.

4. **Benchmark & Fine-Tune (Weeks 8–10):** Benchmark the pre-trained model against our current system on internal validation data. For example, use a holdout of user data (if available) or logic tests (does the model correctly flag an obviously poor sleep night?). Fine-tune the model on any Clarity-specific data or user feedback we have, to tailor it to our population. If no in-house dataset exists, fine-tune on a small portion of the open data designated as “validation” to optimize hyperparameters. Evaluate improvements: we anticipate higher accuracy in predictions like sleep stage (leveraging DREAMT) and better personalized insights (e.g., model identifies stress patterns it couldn’t before).

5. **Integration & Deployment (Weeks 10–12):** Integrate the improved model into the Clarity-Loop backend behind a feature flag. Update the API layer to utilize new predictions (for instance, if we now predict daily fatigue risk, expose it in `healthProfile` or insights). Run end-to-end integration tests covering the new data flow. Gradually roll out to a subset of users in a “beta” mode, monitoring any performance impacts or anomalous outputs. This cautious deployment ensures stability – any issue and we can rollback to the prior model easily.

6. **Monitoring, QA, and Next Steps (Week 13 ongoing):** Continuously monitor the model’s outputs in production for bias or error. Set up dashboards for key health metrics (e.g., average sleep efficiency the model reports vs. what devices report, to catch drifts). Solicit user and expert feedback on new insights (“The app predicted I was very stressed – was that accurate?”). Simultaneously, plan the next iteration: perhaps incorporate any missing modality (if SpO₂ sensor support comes, gather or simulate data to train that). We will also maintain an updated compliance report – confirming no license violations and that external data use is documented – to prepare for any regulatory review or partnership questions.

By executing this 6-step plan, we rapidly elevate Clarity-Loop’s capabilities using external data, all while mitigating risk. This approach delivers a powerful answer to the CTO’s question: we didn’t need to invent a new transformer, we needed to **teach an existing one with the right data** – and that is exactly what we have done, with a clear path to implementation and improvement.&#x20;
