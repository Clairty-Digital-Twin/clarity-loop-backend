# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Real-time WebSocket Chat Interface for AI Health Conversations
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 15, 29, 33, 34
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a WebSocket-based chat system that enables real-time conversations between users and AI about their health data, incorporating conversation context management, streaming responses, health data context injection, and integration with PAT analysis and Gemini narrative generation.
# Details:
1. Set up WebSocket server using FastAPI's WebSocket support
2. Implement client-side WebSocket connection handling in the frontend
3. Create a conversation context management system:
   - Design a data structure to store conversation history
   - Implement methods to update and retrieve context
4. Develop a streaming response mechanism:
   - Implement server-side streaming of AI responses
   - Create client-side handling of streamed responses
5. Implement health data context injection:
   - Create an interface to fetch relevant health data from the Patient Digital Twin System
   - Develop a method to inject health data into the conversation context
6. Integrate with PAT (Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer) analysis:
   - Create an API client to communicate with the PAT Model Service
   - Implement logic to incorporate PAT analysis results into the conversation
7. Integrate with Gemini narrative generation:
   - Develop an API client for the Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 Pro Integration Service
   - Implement logic to generate and incorporate narratives into the chat
8. Implement error handling and reconnection logic for WebSocket connections
9. Develop a queueing system for handling multiple concurrent chat sessions
10. Implement chat session persistence using Firebase Firestore
11. Create a rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse
12. Implement HIPAA-compliant logging for chat sessions
13. Develop unit tests for each component of the chat system
14. Create integration tests to verify the entire chat flow
15. Implement end-to-end encryption for chat messages
16. Develop a mechanism for AI to request additional information or clarification from users
17. Create a system for handling user feedback and improving AI responses over time

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test WebSocket connection establishment and message handling
   - Verify conversation context management functions
   - Test streaming response mechanism
   - Validate health data context injection
   - Ensure correct integration with PAT analysis and Gemini narrative generation
   - Verify error handling and reconnection logic

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the complete chat flow from user input to AI response
   - Verify correct interaction between all integrated components (WebSocket, PAT, Gemini, etc.)
   - Test persistence of chat sessions in Firebase Firestore
   - Validate rate limiting mechanism

3. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load tests to ensure system can handle multiple concurrent chat sessions
   - Measure and optimize response times for AI-generated content

4. Security Testing:
   - Verify end-to-end encryption of chat messages
   - Test HIPAA compliance of logging system
   - Perform penetration testing on the WebSocket server

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct usability tests with a group of test users
   - Gather feedback on AI response quality and conversation flow

6. Compliance Testing:
   - Verify that all HIPAA requirements are met in the chat system
   - Ensure proper handling of sensitive health information

7. Regression Testing:
   - Run a comprehensive test suite after each major update to ensure no existing functionality is broken

8. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test system behavior with very long conversations
   - Verify handling of unexpected user inputs or AI responses

9. Accessibility Testing:
   - Ensure the chat interface is accessible to users with disabilities

10. Cross-browser and Cross-device Testing:
    - Verify functionality across different browsers and devices
