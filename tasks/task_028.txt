# Task ID: 28
# Title: Create Firestore Client Module for Google Cloud Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the firestore_client.py module that provides a comprehensive interface for Google Cloud Firestore integration, document storage, and health data operations.
# Details:
1. Create a new file `firestore_client.py` in the appropriate directory structure
2. Implement Firebase Admin SDK initialization with proper credential management
3. Develop a FirestoreClient class with the following components:
   - Connection pooling and management for efficient resource utilization
   - Asynchronous methods for all database operations
   - Comprehensive CRUD operations for health data documents
   - Batch operation support for efficient bulk operations
   - Transaction support for atomic operations
   - Query builder methods with filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - Document reference and collection management
   - Data validation and sanitization before storage
   - Error handling with specific exception types for different failure scenarios
4. Implement health data specific operations:
   - Methods for storing and retrieving patient records
   - Functions for managing medical data with appropriate schemas
   - Time-series data storage and retrieval for health metrics
   - Support for document versioning and history tracking
5. Add performance optimization features:
   - Caching layer for frequently accessed documents
   - Query optimization techniques
   - Connection pooling and reuse
6. Implement security features:
   - Data encryption for sensitive health information
   - Access control integration
   - Audit logging for all data operations
7. Create helper methods for common Firestore patterns:
   - Pagination handling
   - Real-time listeners and subscription management
   - Bulk operations and batching
8. Add comprehensive documentation:
   - Method documentation with type hints
   - Usage examples
   - Performance considerations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for each method in the FirestoreClient class
   - Use mocking to simulate Firestore responses and errors
   - Test all CRUD operations with various data types and edge cases
   - Verify error handling for network issues, permission problems, and invalid data
   - Test transaction and batch operation functionality
   - Validate connection pooling and resource management

2. Integration Tests:
   - Set up a Firestore emulator for integration testing
   - Test complete workflows from document creation to retrieval and deletion
   - Verify proper interaction with actual Firestore APIs
   - Test performance under various load conditions
   - Validate data consistency across operations

3. Health Data Specific Tests:
   - Create tests for health data schemas and validation
   - Verify proper handling of medical data formats
   - Test time-series data storage and retrieval accuracy
   - Validate document versioning and history tracking

4. Security Testing:
   - Verify proper encryption of sensitive data
   - Test access control mechanisms
   - Validate audit logging functionality

5. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark read/write operations under various loads
   - Test caching effectiveness
   - Measure connection pool efficiency
   - Verify resource cleanup and memory management

6. Manual Testing:
   - Create a simple CLI tool to interact with the Firestore client
   - Manually verify complex operations and edge cases
   - Test real-time listener functionality

7. Documentation Verification:
   - Review API documentation for completeness
   - Verify all examples work as documented
