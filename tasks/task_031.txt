# Task ID: 31
# Title: Create End-to-End Integration Test for Health Data Upload Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 30
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive end-to-end integration tests for the health data upload flow, including authentication, data processing, and database verification to ensure the entire pipeline functions correctly.
# Details:
1. Create a new test module `test_health_data_integration.py` in the tests directory:
   - Import necessary testing libraries (pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx)
   - Set up test fixtures for authenticated client sessions
   - Configure test database connections with isolation

2. Implement authentication test setup:
   - Create mock Firebase authentication tokens for testing
   - Implement test fixtures that simulate authenticated users with different permission levels
   - Set up proper teardown to clean authentication state

3. Develop the main integration test scenarios:
   - Test successful health data upload flow from end to end
   - Test authentication failure scenarios and proper error responses
   - Test validation failures with invalid health data formats
   - Test concurrent upload scenarios to verify data integrity
   - Test performance under simulated load conditions

4. Implement database verification components:
   - Create utilities to verify data was correctly stored in Firestore
   - Implement comparison between uploaded data and stored data
   - Verify proper user association and permissions in the database
   - Test data retrieval after upload to confirm end-to-end flow

5. Create mocking utilities for external dependencies:
   - Mock Firebase authentication service for predictable test behavior
   - Create test doubles for any third-party health data services
   - Implement controlled network failure scenarios

6. Implement test data generators:
   - Create factories for generating realistic health data samples
   - Implement parameterized tests with various data types and volumes
   - Generate edge cases automatically to test system boundaries

7. Set up CI/CD integration:
   - Configure the integration tests to run in the CI pipeline
   - Set up test reporting and failure notifications
   - Implement test coverage tracking for integration tests

# Test Strategy:
1. Manual Verification:
   - Execute the integration tests locally to verify they run successfully
   - Check that all test scenarios are covered including happy paths and error cases
   - Verify that the tests are properly isolated and don't affect production data

2. Automated Test Verification:
   - Ensure all tests pass in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Verify test coverage meets the established threshold (aim for >85% coverage)
   - Check that tests run within acceptable time limits (under 2 minutes for the suite)

3. Validation Testing:
   - Deliberately introduce bugs in the upload flow to verify tests catch them
   - Test with different network conditions to ensure resilience
   - Verify authentication failures are properly detected and reported

4. Performance Testing:
   - Run the tests with increasing load to identify performance bottlenecks
   - Measure and record response times for baseline performance metrics
   - Verify the system handles concurrent uploads correctly

5. Security Testing:
   - Verify that authentication bypass attempts are detected and blocked
   - Ensure proper error messages don't leak sensitive information
   - Test that unauthorized access to other users' data is prevented

6. Code Review:
   - Have team members review the test code for completeness and correctness
   - Verify that the tests follow project testing standards and patterns
   - Ensure tests are maintainable and well-documented
