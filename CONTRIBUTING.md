## üéØ **From Research to Reality: Building the Future of Digital Psychiatry**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is research and educational software only. Not validated for clinical use or FDA approved. We have a long way to go before real-world deployment.**

We're building something unprecedented - but we're doing it RIGHT. This is your roadmap from "fix a typo" to "contribute to the future of mental healthcare."

---

## üî¨ **REALITY CHECK: Where We Are**

- **Status**: Early-stage research & development
- **Purpose**: Educational exploration of digital psychiatry concepts  
- **Validation**: Academic research only - NOT clinical ready
- **Timeline**: Years of development, testing, and validation ahead

**BUT** the vision is real, and every contribution matters.
