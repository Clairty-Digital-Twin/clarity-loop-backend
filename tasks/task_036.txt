# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Complete Vertical Slice: Apple Watch to AI Insights
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33, 34, 35, 4, 13, 12, 15, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an end-to-end flow that processes Apple Watch/HealthKit data through the PAT model for actigraphy analysis, generates personalized insights with Gemini AI, and delivers results via real-time WebSocket chat.
# Details:
1. Integrate Apple HealthKit API:
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 for Apple HealthKit authorization
   - Create data fetching service for relevant health metrics (activity, sleep, heart rate)
   - Implement data normalization and preprocessing

2. Connect to PAT (Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer) Model Service:
   - Implement API client for the PAT model service (Task 33)
   - Create data transformation layer to convert HealthKit data to PAT input format
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms

3. Integrate Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 Pro Service:
   - Create service client for Gemini AI (Task 34)
   - Develop prompt engineering pipeline to convert PAT analysis and health data into Gemini-ready format
   - Implement response parsing and post-processing

4. Implement Real-time WebSocket Chat Integration:
   - Connect to WebSocket chat interface (Task 35)
   - Develop message routing system to handle user queries
   - Create context management system to maintain conversation state

5. Develop End-to-end Pipeline:
   - Create orchestration service to manage data flow between components
   - Implement caching mechanism for frequent data requests
   - Develop error handling and logging throughout the pipeline

6. Optimize Performance:
   - Implement asynchronous processing where possible
   - Use background tasks for long-running operations
   - Optimize database queries and implement connection pooling

7. Ensure Security and Compliance:
   - Implement end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
   - Ensure HIPAA compliance for data handling and storage
   - Implement audit logging for all data access and transformations

8. Create User Interface for Demo:
   - Develop a simple web interface to showcase the end-to-end flow
   - Implement real-time updates using WebSocket connection
   - Create visualizations for health data and AI insights

9. Implement Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring:
   - Set up distributed tracing across all services
   - Implement performance monitoring and alerting
   - Create dashboards for key metrics and system health

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for each component (HealthKit integration, PAT service client, Gemini AI client, WebSocket chat)
   - Use mock objects to simulate dependencies and test edge cases

2. Integration Testing:
   - Develop integration tests for each pair of connected components
   - Create test fixtures with sample health data
   - Verify correct data flow and transformations between services

3. End-to-end Testing:
   - Implement automated end-to-end tests simulating complete user flow
   - Use real Apple Watch data (with user consent) for testing
   - Verify accuracy of PAT analysis and relevance of Gemini AI insights

4. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load testing to ensure system can handle multiple concurrent users
   - Measure and optimize response times for each step in the pipeline
   - Identify and resolve any bottlenecks

5. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing on the entire system
   - Verify proper encryption of sensitive data
   - Ensure compliance with HIPAA requirements

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct beta testing with a small group of users
   - Gather feedback on the accuracy of insights and user experience
   - Iterate based on user feedback

7. Compliance Verification:
   - Review all data handling processes for HIPAA compliance
   - Conduct an internal audit of security measures
   - Prepare documentation for potential regulatory review

8. Monitoring and Logging Verification:
   - Verify that all critical events are properly logged
   - Test alerting mechanisms for various failure scenarios
   - Ensure traceability of requests through the entire system

9. Cross-platform Testing:
   - Test compatibility with different Apple Watch models and iOS versions
   - Verify functionality across various web browsers for the demo interface

10. Regression Testing:
    - Develop a comprehensive regression test suite
    - Automate regression tests to run after each significant change or update
