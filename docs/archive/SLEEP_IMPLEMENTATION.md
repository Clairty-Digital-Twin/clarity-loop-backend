# **IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT BELOW**

*Ready to implement when priority shifts to new features*

Understood. I'll design a turn-key, code-focused blueprint for a modular SleepProcessor using statistical feature extraction from Apple HealthKit sleep data—fully integrated into your current clarity-loop-backend architecture. I'll also evaluate any lightweight pretrained models (like SleepTransformer) that could be trivially added, and show how to optionally extend the processor if they meet your simplicity and maintainability criteria.

The plan will include file paths, class signatures, example payloads, feature extraction algorithms, pipeline wiring, Gemini prompt changes, and full test coverage scaffolding.

I'll update you with the complete implementation-ready guide shortly.

# SleepProcessor Implementation Blueprint

## 1. Module Creation and Placement

**File Path:** Create a new processor module at `src/clarity/ml/processors/sleep_processor.py` within the analysis service, alongside existing processors (Cardio, Respiration, Activity). This ensures the SleepProcessor follows the project's modular architecture. The file will contain a Pydantic data model for sleep features and the SleepProcessor class implementation:

```python
# File: src/clarity/ml/processors/sleep_processor.py
import logging
from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Constants (e.g., for scoring thresholds, circadian calc)
IDEAL_SLEEP_HOURS = 8  # Recommended sleep duration for adults
CONSISTENCY_STD_THRESHOLD = 60  # 60 minutes std dev as low consistency threshold

class SleepFeatures(BaseModel):
    """Sleep-related features extracted from sleep stage data."""
    total_sleep_minutes: int = Field(..., description="Total sleep duration (minutes)")
    sleep_efficiency: float = Field(..., description="Sleep efficiency (0-1 ratio)")
    sleep_latency: float = Field(..., description="Sleep onset latency (minutes)")
    waso_minutes: float = Field(..., description="Wake After Sleep Onset (minutes)")
    awakenings_count: int = Field(..., description="Number of awakenings after sleep onset")
    rem_percentage: float = Field(..., description="REM sleep as percentage of total sleep (0-1)")
    deep_percentage: float = Field(..., description="Deep sleep as percentage of total sleep (0-1)")
    consistency_score: float = Field(..., description="Sleep schedule consistency score (0-1)")
```

**Explanation:** We define `SleepFeatures` to structure the output feature vector for sleep. This includes commonly used sleep quality metrics: total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, WASO (Wake After Sleep Onset), number of awakenings, REM% and deep% of sleep, and a consistency score reflecting night-to-night regularity. Each field has a description for clarity. The SleepProcessor will compute these and return a `SleepFeatures` instance (which behaves similarly to `CardioFeatures` in CardioProcessor).

**Notes:**

- The `process` method expects a list of `HealthMetric` objects (each with `metric_type = SLEEP_ANALYSIS`). It iterates over each metric (each representing one sleep session, e.g., one night's sleep) to gather raw values. It uses `metric.sleep_data` (a `SleepData` Pydantic model) to retrieve fields like total sleep minutes, efficiency, latency, etc. If any expected fields (like `wake_count` or `sleep_stages`) are missing, it derives the values from raw data if possible. For example, if `sleep_stages` are provided, it uses the `"awake"` minutes to compute WASO (Wake After Sleep Onset). If not, it falls back to calculating WASO as the difference between time in bed and actual sleep time (ensuring a non-negative result).

- **REM% and Deep%:** If stage breakdown is available from Apple HealthKit, the code computes REM and deep sleep percentages by dividing the minutes in REM or deep by total sleep minutes. For instance, if REM sleep was 90 min out of 420 total, `rem_percentage = 0.214` (\~21.4%). If no stage data is present (e.g., older devices that only report total sleep), it sets these to 0.0 by default.

- **Latency and Awakenings:** `sleep_latency` is taken from `SleepData.time_to_sleep_minutes` if provided (the time it took to fall asleep). `awakenings_count` comes from `SleepData.wake_count` (number of awakenings during the sleep period) or is set to 0 if unavailable. These metrics align with standard definitions: sleep latency = minutes to fall asleep, and awakenings count = number of wake episodes after sleep onset.

- **Consistency Score:** To quantify **sleep schedule consistency**, the processor computes a simple score based on the variability of sleep start times across multiple nights. Here we calculate the standard deviation of sleep start times (converted to minutes of the day). A lower std dev means the user goes to bed at a more regular time nightly. We then map this to a 0–1 range (e.g., <15 min std dev yields \~1.0, >2 hours yields 0.0, linear interpolation in between). This is a simplified regularity metric; it follows the spirit of the **Sleep Regularity Index (SRI)** concept from recent literature (which assesses night-to-night variability), without requiring minute-by-minute data. This consistency_score will be 0.5 (neutral) if only one night is present (insufficient data to judge consistency, similar to how CardioProcessor returns a neutral 0.5 for circadian score if data is limited).

- The processor logs key results for debugging (average total sleep, efficiency, REM%). The output is returned as a `SleepFeatures` instance (which is a BaseModel, similar to how `CardioProcessor.process` returns a `CardioFeatures` model). This ensures the features are well-structured and easily serializable.

**Pydantic Model Updates:** No fundamental changes to existing Pydantic models are required for basic functionality since `SleepData` already contains the necessary fields (`total_sleep_minutes`, `sleep_efficiency`, etc.). However, to fully leverage Apple's detailed data, we ensure `SleepData.sleep_stages` (a dict of SleepStage to minutes) and fields like `wake_count` and `time_to_sleep_minutes` are populated by the ingestion layer. If needed, the `SleepStage` enum can be extended or mapped to Apple's stage labels (Apple uses categories like "Core" sleep for light sleep; we map those to our `SleepStage.LIGHT`). If Apple's JSON uses slightly different keys ("REM Sleep" vs "rem"), the ingestion adapter should translate them to our enum names. The `HealthMetricType` enum already has `SLEEP_ANALYSIS` defined, and our pipeline organizer already groups "sleep_analysis" metrics under the "sleep" modality, so the new processor will naturally pick them up.

## 3. Parsing Apple HealthKit Sleep Data (JSON Ingestion)

**Example Apple HealthKit Sleep Payload:** Apple HealthKit provides sleep analysis as category samples, which can include sleep stages (available on Apple Watch since watchOS 9). A typical JSON payload from the iOS app might list segments of sleep with start/end times and categories. In our system, the ingestion service should consolidate these into a nightly summary metric. For example, an Apple HealthKit nightly record (in a hypothetical simplified JSON) could look like:

```json
{
  "metric_type": "sleep_analysis",
  "sleep_data": {
    "total_sleep_minutes": 420,
    "sleep_efficiency": 0.875,
    "time_to_sleep_minutes": 15,
    "wake_count": 2,
    "sleep_stages": {
      "awake": 45,
      "rem": 90,
      "light": 240,
      "deep": 90
    },
    "sleep_start": "2025-06-01T23:00:00Z",
    "sleep_end": "2025-06-02T07:00:00Z"
  },
  "raw_data": {
    "segments": [
      {"stage": "Awake", "start": "2025-06-01T23:00:00Z", "end": "2025-06-01T23:15:00Z"},
      {"stage": "REM",   "start": "2025-06-01T23:15:00Z", "end": "2025-06-01T23:45:00Z"},
      {"stage": "Light", "start": "2025-06-01T23:45:00Z", "end": "2025-06-02T02:30:00Z"},
      {"stage": "Deep",  "start": "2025-06-02T02:30:00Z", "end": "2025-06-02T03:30:00Z"},
      {"stage": "REM",   "start": "2025-06-02T03:30:00Z", "end": "2025-06-02T04:15:00Z"},
      {"stage": "Light", "start": "2025-06-02T04:15:00Z", "end": "2025-06-02T06:30:00Z"},
      {"stage": "Awake", "start": "2025-06-02T06:30:00Z", "end": "2025-06-02T07:00:00Z"}
    ]
  }
}
```

In this example, the `sleep_data` summary indicates the person was in bed from 23:00 to 07:00 (8 hours), with 420 minutes asleep. Sleep efficiency is 0.875 (which is 420/480, meaning 87.5% of time in bed was spent sleeping). They took 15 minutes to fall asleep (sleep latency), and woke up 2 times during the night. The stage breakdown shows 90 min REM, 90 min Deep, 240 min Light, and 45 min Awake (note: the `awake` total of 45 min here would typically exclude the initial 15 min latency if we accounted separately; in this example, it likely includes 15 min initial + 30 min of nocturnal awakening, totaling 45). The raw segments array illustrates how these stages might be logged over the night.

**Parsing Logic:** The ingestion adapter (e.g., `AppleHealthAdapter`) should translate raw HealthKit data into our domain model. Likely steps:

- **Consolidation:** HealthKit might provide multiple segments per night (as shown). The adapter should group segments by date (or sleep session) and compute totals:

  - Calculate `total_sleep_minutes` as sum of all "sleeping" stages (REM+Light+Deep durations).
  - Determine `sleep_start` as the time the user went to bed (or when the first segment starts, which might be labeled Awake if they lay in bed awake).
  - Determine `sleep_end` as wake-up time (end of the last segment).
  - Compute `time_to_sleep_minutes` as the gap between bed time and sleep onset (if the first segment is Awake, that duration is latency).
  - Count awakenings: each transition from sleep to wake after sleep onset can be counted as an awakening. In the raw example above, there is an awake segment at 06:30 after a prior sleep segment – that indicates an awakening. The adapter can count such occurrences (here 1 awakening during the night, but if we also count final wake-up as an awakening, it might be 2; interpretations vary, but we align with counting distinct mid-sleep awakenings).
  - Compute `sleep_efficiency` = total\_sleep\_minutes / (time in bed). Time in bed is (sleep\_end - sleep\_start). In the above example, time in bed = 480 min, efficiency = 420/480 = 0.875.

- **Populate SleepData:** Create a `HealthMetric(metric_type=SLEEP_ANALYSIS, sleep_data=SleepData(...))` with the computed fields. For consistency, map Apple's stage labels to our `SleepStage` enum: Apple's "Core" or "Light" -> SleepStage.LIGHT, "Deep" -> SleepStage.DEEP, "REM" -> SleepStage.REM, and any wake segments -> SleepStage.AWAKE. The example above already uses our enum names in lowercase for clarity.

The ingestion layer should perform this parsing. If it doesn't (as of now, the stub just puts total minutes and efficiency without stages), the SleepProcessor itself will still handle it: our `process` method uses `raw_data` segments if needed to compute WASO and awakenings. For instance, if `metric.sleep_data.wake_count` is None but `raw_data["segments"]` exists, we could count how many `"Awake"` segments occur after the first sleep onset, and set that as `wake_count`. Similarly, we could infer `sleep_stages` by summing segment durations by type. This would make SleepProcessor robust to incomplete ingestion. However, ideally the upstream adapter provides these to avoid duplication of logic.

By adhering to these parsing rules, we leverage best practices from clinical sleep research: **WASO** is defined as minutes awake after initial sleep onset and before final awakening; **sleep efficiency** is the percentage of time in bed spent asleep; etc. Datasets like NSRR and MESA follow similar definitions, so our computations align with research standards (e.g., MESA defines WASO and sleep efficiency in line with these formulas).

## 4. Integration into the Analysis Pipeline

Once the SleepProcessor is implemented, we integrate it into the analysis workflow:

**a. Registering the Processor:** Update the `HealthAnalysisPipeline` initialization in `src/clarity/ml/analysis_pipeline.py` to include an instance of SleepProcessor. In the `__init__` method of `HealthAnalysisPipeline`:

```python
from clarity.ml.processors.sleep_processor import SleepProcessor

class HealthAnalysisPipeline:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        ...
        self.cardio_processor = CardioProcessor()
        self.respiratory_processor = RespirationProcessor()
        self.activity_processor = ActivityProcessor()
        self.sleep_processor = SleepProcessor()  # NEW: Sleep data processor
        ...
```

This ensures the pipeline has a SleepProcessor ready to use, similar to other modality processors.

**b. Organizing Sleep Metrics:** The `_organize_metrics_by_modality` helper already buckets metrics with `metric_type` `"sleep_analysis"` into `organized_data["sleep"]`. We leverage that existing structure. No changes needed there (it covers "sleep_duration" as well, in case a different label is used).

**c. Processing Sleep Modality:** Add a new block in `HealthAnalysisPipeline.process_health_data` to handle the "sleep" modality, analogous to cardio, respiratory, etc. For example, after activity:

```python
# File: src/clarity/ml/analysis_pipeline.py (within process_health_data)
if organized_data["sleep"]:
    self.logger.info("Processing sleep data...")
    sleep_features = self.sleep_processor.process(organized_data["sleep"])
    results.sleep_features = sleep_features
    # For fusion, represent sleep_features as a numeric vector (list of floats)
    sleep_vector = [
        sleep_features.total_sleep_minutes,
        sleep_features.sleep_efficiency * 100.0,  # convert to percentage for magnitude consistency
        sleep_features.sleep_latency,
        sleep_features.waso_minutes,
        sleep_features.awakenings_count,
        sleep_features.rem_percentage * 100.0,
        sleep_features.deep_percentage * 100.0,
        sleep_features.consistency_score
    ]
    modality_features["sleep"] = sleep_vector
```

Here we log the processing step, call our `sleep_processor.process` with the list of HealthMetric objects, and store the resulting `SleepFeatures` in `results.sleep_features`. We then convert the SleepFeatures model to a raw list of floats (`sleep_vector`) for use in `modality_features`. The conversion multiplies some ratios by 100 to express them as percentages (this is optional, but for fusion it may help to have features on similar scales – e.g., sleep\_efficiency 0.85 becomes 85.0 so that it's in a comparable range to heart rate or SpO₂ percentages). We include consistency\_score as-is (0-1). Now `modality_features["sleep"]` is an 8-dimensional vector. This pattern matches other processors: e.g., Cardio and Respiration fill `modality_features` with list of floats (their BaseModel features are implicitly treated as sequences). By adding "sleep" to `modality_features`, the subsequent fusion step will include sleep in the unified health state vector if multiple modalities are present.

**d. Fusing or Using Sleep Alone:** The pipeline's fusion logic remains unchanged. If sleep is the only modality in the upload (len(modality\_features)==1), it will skip the Transformer and use the sleep vector as `results.fused_vector` directly. If there are multiple modalities (e.g., sleep + activity + cardio), the sleep vector will be one input to the FusionTransformer. (The Fusion model may need retraining or at least the architecture should accept an extra token for sleep – since originally it may not have included sleep. However, since the design anticipated adding modalities, we assume the fusion model can handle a "sleep" token. We might update `fusion_transformer.py` to add a token embedding for sleep if needed, or simply rely on a generic mechanism if it treats each modality vector uniformly.)

**e. Summary Stats and Output:** We must incorporate sleep metrics into the summary statistics and persisted analysis results:

- **Summary Stats:** The `_generate_summary_stats` function can be extended to include sleep-specific highlights. For instance, after the activity section in `summary["health_indicators"]`, we add:

  ```python
  if "sleep" in modality_features and results.sleep_features:
      sf = results.sleep_features  # SleepFeatures object
      # Summarize key sleep metrics (converting to user-friendly units)
      summary["health_indicators"]["sleep_health"] = {
          "total_sleep_time": round(sf.total_sleep_minutes / 60, 1),  # hours
          "sleep_efficiency": round(sf.sleep_efficiency * 100, 1),    # percent
          "sleep_latency": round(sf.sleep_latency, 1),               # minutes
          "waso": round(sf.waso_minutes, 1),                        # minutes awake after onset
          "awakenings": sf.awakenings_count,
          "rem_percent": round(sf.rem_percentage * 100, 1),
          "deep_percent": round(sf.deep_percentage * 100, 1),
          "sleep_consistency": round(sf.consistency_score, 2)
      }
  ```

  This will include a `sleep_health` entry in `summary_stats["health_indicators"]` with user-friendly values. We convert minutes to hours for total sleep (since the LLM narrative might express sleep in hours) and ratios to percentages for efficiency and stage percentages. We now surface the key insights: sleep duration, efficiency, latency, WASO, etc. For example, if total\_sleep\_minutes was 420, this stores `"total_sleep_time": 7.0` hours. If efficiency was 0.875, this stores `"sleep_efficiency": 87.5` (%). These metrics align with clinical standards (e.g., sleep efficiency >85% is typically considered good, WASO under 20 min is excellent).

- **Firestore Storage:** Update the Firestore saving logic to include the sleep features. In `FirestoreClient.save_analysis_result`, we saw it building `analysis_data` with keys for cardio, respiratory, etc.. We should add:

  ```python
  analysis_data = {
      ...
      "sleep_features": analysis_result.get("sleep_features", []),
      ...
  }
  ```

  And ensure our `analysis_result` dict (from `run_analysis_pipeline`) includes a `"sleep_features"` entry. We will modify `run_analysis_pipeline` in `analysis_pipeline.py` to add it:

  ```python
  results = await pipeline.process_health_data(user_id, health_metrics)
  return {
      "user_id": user_id,
      "cardio_features": results.cardio_features,
      "respiratory_features": results.respiratory_features,
      "activity_features": results.activity_features,
      "activity_embedding": results.activity_embedding,
      "sleep_features": results.sleep_features,            # NEW line
      "fused_vector": results.fused_vector,
      "summary_stats": results.summary_stats,
      "processing_metadata": results.processing_metadata,
  }
  ```

  This way, when the pipeline finishes, the returned dict includes the SleepFeatures object (Pydantic models are JSON-serializable; Pydantic v2's BaseModel will serialize to dict automatically when saved to Firestore, or we can call `.model_dump()` explicitly if needed). Including `sleep_features` ensures the raw numeric feature vector is saved for further analysis or debugging.

## 5. Gemini LLM Prompt Adaptation for Sleep Insights

With sleep metrics being analyzed and stored, we want the Large Language Model (Gemini 2.5) to incorporate these insights into the user's health narrative. The `GeminiService` in `src/clarity/ml/gemini_service.py` constructs a prompt using key metrics. We will update this to inject our sleep features:

- **Extend Analysis Results for LLM:** Before calling `GeminiService.generate_health_insights`, ensure the `analysis_results` dict contains high-level sleep keys. We have already placed `sleep_features` (a structured object) and summary stats in the Firestore document. The LLM prompt builder likely uses either `summary_stats` or expects flattened fields. In the current `GeminiService`, we see references like:

  ```python
  sleep_efficiency = analysis_results.get("sleep_efficiency", 0)
  total_sleep_time = analysis_results.get("total_sleep_time", 0)
  wake_after_sleep_onset = analysis_results.get("wake_after_sleep_onset", 0)
  sleep_onset_latency = analysis_results.get("sleep_onset_latency", 0)
  circadian_score = analysis_results.get("circadian_rhythm_score", 0)
  ...
  # Then formats:
  f"- Sleep Efficiency: {sleep_efficiency:.1f}%\n- Circadian Rhythm Score: {circadian_score:.2f}\n... - Total Sleep Time: {total_sleep_time:.1f} hours\n- Wake After Sleep Onset: {wake_after_sleep_onset:.1f} minutes\n- Sleep Onset Latency: {sleep_onset_latency:.1f} minutes\n"
  ```

This indicates the LLM expects keys named exactly `sleep_efficiency`, `total_sleep_time`, `wake_after_sleep_onset`, etc., in the `analysis_results`. We will map our computed `SleepFeatures` into these keys when preparing the insight request.

- **Populate Insight Fields:** We can do this in the publisher or directly in `GeminiService`. A straightforward approach is to modify the publisher (`publish_insight_request` in `clarity/services/pubsub/publisher.py` if it exists, or directly in `analysis_subscriber.py` after obtaining analysis\_results):

  For example, in `AnalysisSubscriber.process_health_data_message`, after getting `analysis_results` from the pipeline, we could do:

  ```python
  # Flatten sleep metrics for LLM
  if "sleep_features" in analysis_results:
      sf = analysis_results["sleep_features"]
      # Ensure BaseModel is dict
      if hasattr(sf, "model_dump"):
          sf = sf.model_dump()  # convert to dict if Pydantic model
      analysis_results["sleep_efficiency"] = sf.get("sleep_efficiency", 0) * 100  # as percentage
      analysis_results["total_sleep_time"] = (sf.get("total_sleep_minutes", 0) / 60)
      analysis_results["wake_after_sleep_onset"] = sf.get("waso_minutes", 0)
      analysis_results["sleep_onset_latency"] = sf.get("sleep_latency", 0)
      # We can also include rem_percent or deep_percent if we want LLM to mention sleep architecture
      analysis_results["rem_sleep_percent"] = sf.get("rem_percentage", 0) * 100
      analysis_results["deep_sleep_percent"] = sf.get("deep_percentage", 0) * 100
      # Provide consistency in a user-friendly way (e.g., good/moderate/irregular):
      cons_score = sf.get("consistency_score", 0)
      analysis_results["sleep_consistency_rating"] = ("high" if cons_score > 0.8 
                                                      else "moderate" if cons_score > 0.5 
                                                      else "low")
  ```

  This adds flat keys that the LLM prompt can use. We multiply the efficiency by 100 so that `sleep_efficiency` is e.g. 87.5 (representing percent). `total_sleep_time` is in hours. WASO and latency remain in minutes.

- **Update Prompt Template:** In `GeminiService._build_prompt()` (or wherever the f-string is built for the system message), insert any new lines if needed. The current template already covers the essentials:

  - Sleep Efficiency
  - Total Sleep Time
  - WASO (Wake After Sleep Onset)
  - Sleep Onset Latency
  - Circadian Rhythm Score (which we provide via cardio or could replace with our consistency if desired)

  We may choose to include REM% and Deep% in the prompt if we think the LLM should mention sleep architecture. For brevity, we might not list every metric in the bullet points (the current design didn't explicitly include REM% in the bullet list). However, we could append an additional context line:

  ```python
  f"- REM Sleep: {analysis_data.get('rem_sleep_percent', 0):.1f}%\n- Deep Sleep: {analysis_data.get('deep_sleep_percent', 0):.1f}%\n"
  ```

  And perhaps:

  ```python
  f"- Sleep Schedule Consistency: {analysis_data.get('sleep_consistency_rating', 'moderate').capitalize()}\n"
  ```

  This would signal to the LLM whether the user's bed/wake times are regular or irregular, which it can incorporate into its narrative (e.g., *"Your sleep timing is quite irregular; varying bedtimes can affect sleep quality"* if consistency is low).

- **Gemini Service Example Changes:**

  ```python
  # File: src/clarity/ml/gemini_service.py
  class GeminiService:
      ...
      def _construct_system_prompt(self, analysis_data: dict, context: str | None):
          sleep_eff = analysis_data.get("sleep_efficiency", 0)
          circadian = analysis_data.get("circadian_rhythm_score", analysis_data.get("sleep_consistency_score", 0))
          total_sleep = analysis_data.get("total_sleep_time", 0)
          waso = analysis_data.get("wake_after_sleep_onset", 0)
          latency = analysis_data.get("sleep_onset_latency", 0)
          rem_pct = analysis_data.get("rem_sleep_percent", None)
          deep_pct = analysis_data.get("deep_sleep_percent", None)
          consistency_label = analysis_data.get("sleep_consistency_rating", "")
          prompt = f"""You are a clinical AI assistant specializing in sleep health and wellness analysis.
          
  ```

- Sleep Efficiency: {sleep\_eff:.1f}%

- Total Sleep Time: {total\_sleep:.1f} hours

- Wake After Sleep Onset: {waso:.1f} minutes

- Sleep Onset Latency: {latency:.1f} minutes
  """
  if rem\_pct is not None and deep\_pct is not None:
  prompt += f"- REM Sleep: {rem\_pct:.1f}%\n- Deep Sleep: {deep\_pct:.1f}%\n"
  if consistency\_label:
  prompt += f"- Sleep Schedule Consistency: {consistency\_label.capitalize()}\n"
  prompt += "- Circadian Rhythm Score: {circadian:.2f}\n"
  prompt += "- Additional Context: " + (context or "None") + "\n\n"
  prompt += ("- Sleep Efficiency >85% = Excellent, 75-85% = Good, <75% = Needs attention\n"
  "- Consistency: High = very regular schedule, Low = highly irregular bedtimes\n"
  "- Circadian Score >0.8 = Strong, 0.6-0.8 = Moderate, <0.6 = Irregular\n")
  return prompt

  ```

  In this template:
  - We show the computed sleep metrics in bullet form.
  - If REM and Deep percentages are available (they will be if the device tracks stages), we include them.
  - We include a qualitative consistency assessment.
  - We still display the circadian rhythm score (possibly from Cardio HR data), but if we prefer to use our sleep consistency as a proxy for "circadian" in terms of routine, we could feed `analysis_data["circadian_rhythm_score"]` with the sleep consistency score. For now, we leave circadian as originally defined (from Cardio or fusion).
  - We updated the guideline section to mention consistency interpretation.
  ```

These changes ensure the LLM receives all relevant sleep info. For example, the prompt might become:

```
- Sleep Efficiency: 87.5%  
- Total Sleep Time: 7.0 hours  
- Wake After Sleep Onset: 30.0 minutes  
- Sleep Onset Latency: 15.0 minutes  
- REM Sleep: 21.4%  
- Deep Sleep: 21.4%  
- Sleep Schedule Consistency: Moderate  
- Circadian Rhythm Score: 0.75  

- Sleep Efficiency >85% = Excellent, 75-85% = Good, <75% = Needs attention  
- Consistency: High = very regular schedule, Low = highly irregular bedtimes  
- Circadian Score >0.8 = Strong, 0.6-0.8 = Moderate, <0.6 = Irregular
```

With this, Gemini can produce insights like: *"You slept \~7 hours with \~87% efficiency, which is very good. You had a couple of brief awakenings (about 30 min awake after sleep onset) and fell asleep in 15 minutes, indicating relatively normal latency. About 21% of your sleep was REM and 21% deep – a healthy distribution. Your bedtimes were moderately consistent. Overall, your sleep quality is good; maintaining consistency in your schedule could further improve it."* The actual narrative will depend on the LLM, but it now has the data to generate such analysis.

*(We should also note that if any **depression risk score** or other fused metrics are computed later (perhaps by the fusion model), those could be integrated too, but that's beyond our SleepProcessor scope.)*

## 6. Testing the SleepProcessor and Integration

To ensure our implementation works and is idiomatic to the repo, we create comprehensive tests:

### a. Unit Test for SleepProcessor

We will add a unit test in `tests/unit/test_sleep_processor.py` (new file) to verify that the SleepProcessor correctly computes features from controlled inputs. For example:

```python
from datetime import UTC, datetime, timedelta
from clarity.ml.processors.sleep_processor import SleepProcessor
from clarity.models.health_data import HealthMetric, HealthMetricType, SleepData, SleepStage

def test_sleep_processor_single_night():
    """SleepProcessor returns correct features for a single night of sleep data."""
    # Construct a single HealthMetric for sleep with known values
    start = datetime(2025, 6, 1, 23, 0, tzinfo=UTC)
    end = datetime(2025, 6, 2, 7, 0, tzinfo=UTC)
    sleep_data = SleepData(
        total_sleep_minutes=400,
        sleep_efficiency=0.8333,            # 400/480 ~ 0.8333
        time_to_sleep_minutes=20,
        wake_count=2,
        sleep_stages={
            SleepStage.AWAKE: 60,          # 20 min initial + 40 min WASO
            SleepStage.REM: 80,
            SleepStage.LIGHT: 240,
            SleepStage.DEEP: 80
        },
        sleep_start=start,
        sleep_end=end
    )
    metric = HealthMetric(metric_type=HealthMetricType.SLEEP_ANALYSIS, sleep_data=sleep_data)
    processor = SleepProcessor()
    features = processor.process([metric])
    # Validate output
    assert features.total_sleep_minutes == 400
    assert abs(features.sleep_efficiency - 0.8333) < 1e-3
    assert abs(features.sleep_latency - 20.0) < 1e-6
    assert abs(features.waso_minutes - 40.0) < 1e-6   # expected WASO = 60 (awake) - 20 (latency) = 40
    assert features.awakenings_count == 2
    assert abs(features.rem_percentage - 0.20) < 1e-3  # 80/400 = 0.20
    assert abs(features.deep_percentage - 0.20) < 1e-3 # 80/400 = 0.20
    # Only one night, so consistency_score should default (0.5 in our implementation)
    assert abs(features.consistency_score - 0.5) < 1e-6

def test_sleep_processor_multi_night_consistency():
    """SleepProcessor computes consistency score across multiple nights."""
    processor = SleepProcessor()
    metrics = []
    # Create 3 nights with varying start times
    for i, bedtime_hour in enumerate([22, 0, 23]):  # e.g., 10pm, midnight, 11pm
        start = datetime(2025, 6, 1 + i, bedtime_hour, 0, tzinfo=UTC)
        end = start + timedelta(hours=8)
        sleep_data = SleepData(
            total_sleep_minutes=480, sleep_efficiency=1.0,
            time_to_sleep_minutes=0, wake_count=0,
            sleep_stages={SleepStage.AWAKE: 0, SleepStage.REM: 90, SleepStage.LIGHT: 300, SleepStage.DEEP: 90},
            sleep_start=start, sleep_end=end
        )
        metrics.append(HealthMetric(metric_type=HealthMetricType.SLEEP_ANALYSIS, sleep_data=sleep_data))
    features = processor.process(metrics)
    # All nights have full 8h sleep, but bedtimes vary by up to 2 hours -> consistency should be moderate (~0.5 or lower)
    assert features.awakenings_count == 0
    # With bedtimes at 22:00, 00:00, 23:00, std ~ 1 hour => consistency_score ~ somewhere around 0.5
    assert 0.3 <= features.consistency_score <= 0.7
```

This unit test covers both single-night calculation (checking each feature) and multi-night consistency logic.

We should also test edge cases: e.g., no sleep data metrics (processor should return zeros without error), extremely short sleep (to ensure efficiency and WASO calc don't divide by zero), etc. Additionally, verifying that the validator in `SleepData` catches inconsistent inputs is done in `test_health_data_entity.py` already, but we can add a test to ensure our processor doesn't break those rules (for instance, if someone passes sleep\_start >= sleep\_end, our logic might compute negative time\_in\_bed; such metrics wouldn't pass validation anyway).

### b. Integration Test for `/health-data` API including Sleep

If the FastAPI ingestion endpoint is `/health-data` (similar to how stub adapter is wired at `/health-data/stub`), we can simulate an upload payload that includes sleep. For example, in `tests/integration/test_health_data_api.py`:

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient
from main import app  # assuming the FastAPI app is instantiated in main.py

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health_data_upload_with_sleep(monkeypatch):
    # Monkeypatch Pub/Sub to immediate processing for test (or use test mode)
    # Prepare a payload with a sleep metric
    payload = {
        "user_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
        "upload_source": "apple_health",
        "client_timestamp": "2025-06-02T12:00:00Z",
        "metrics": [
            {
                "metric_type": "sleep_analysis",
                "sleep_data": {
                    "total_sleep_minutes": 360,
                    "sleep_efficiency": 0.75,
                    "sleep_start": "2025-06-01T23:30:00Z",
                    "sleep_end": "2025-06-02T07:00:00Z",
                    "time_to_sleep_minutes": 30,
                    "wake_count": 1,
                    "sleep_stages": {"awake": 60, "rem": 60, "light": 180, "deep": 120}
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://testserver") as client:
        resp = await client.post("/v1/health-data", json=payload)
        assert resp.status_code == 200
        data = resp.json()
        # The response might include a processing_id that we can use to fetch results
        processing_id = data.get("processing_id")
        assert processing_id is not None

    # In a real test, we might then simulate the analysis subscriber picking up the message.
    # Here, directly call analysis pipeline for simplicity:
    from clarity.ml.analysis_pipeline import run_analysis_pipeline
    results = await run_analysis_pipeline(user_id=payload["user_id"], health_data=payload)
    # Check that summary_stats in results contain sleep info
    sleep_health = results["summary_stats"]["health_indicators"].get("sleep_health")
    assert sleep_health is not None
    assert abs(sleep_health["sleep_efficiency"] - 75.0) < 0.1  # 75%
    assert sleep_health["awakenings"] == 1
    assert abs(sleep_health["total_sleep_time"] - 6.0) < 0.1   # 6 hours
```

This integration test simulates the end-to-end flow: posting a health data upload with sleep, then forcing the analysis (in test, we directly call `run_analysis_pipeline` for simplicity). We then verify that the summary stats contain a `sleep_health` section with the expected values (e.g., 6 hours, 75% efficiency, 1 awakening as given in input). This ensures that our SleepProcessor integrated correctly and its outputs propagated to the summary.

*(Depending on the test harness, we might need to adjust how Pub/Sub is bypassed. Alternatively, since the pipeline is synchronous in tests, calling `run_analysis_pipeline` directly is sufficient, as done above.)*

### c. Regression Test for LLM Insight Generation

Finally, we want to ensure that adding sleep data doesn't break the insight generation and that key insights are included. We can write a test for the Gemini prompt construction (without calling the actual external API). For example, in `tests/unit/test_gemini_prompt.py`:

```python
from clarity.ml.gemini_service import GeminiService, HealthInsightRequest

def test_gemini_prompt_includes_sleep_metrics():
    service = GeminiService()
    # Monkey-patch the actual LLM call to just return the prompt for testing
    async def fake_generate(request):
        # Directly use the request to build the system prompt string for inspection
        return service._construct_system_prompt(request.analysis_results, request.context)
    service.generate_health_insights = fake_generate  # replace method with fake

This test bypasses actual Vertex AI calls and directly examines the constructed prompt. It verifies that all the sleep metrics appear formatted correctly. If the prompt or key naming changes, this test will catch discrepancies (serving as a regression test for our prompt template).

By running these tests, we can confidently say that the SleepProcessor is correctly implemented and integrated:

- The unit tests ensure the internal calculations (latency, WASO, percentages, consistency) match expected outputs using known inputs grounded in sleep science definitions.
- The integration test confirms end-to-end data flow from API input to stored summary.
- The prompt test ensures that the new data is being fed to the LLM's prompt generation, so the insights delivered to users will include sleep quality details.

## 7. Optional Extension: Integrating a Pretrained Sleep Model

Our focus so far has been on **statistical feature extraction** (which is transparent and easily verifiable). Optionally, we could incorporate a **pretrained Transformer-based sleep model** – for example, a model that produces an embedding or refined metrics from the time-series sleep data. Two candidates mentioned are **SleepTransformer** and **SleepVST**:

- **SleepTransformer**: a sequence-to-sequence model for automatic sleep staging. In our context, we already have sleep stages from HealthKit, so we may not need to redo staging. However, such a model (especially one trained on research datasets like Sleep-EDF or SHHS) could be used to derive a *sleep quality embedding* or to detect micro-patterns (like sleep fragmentation index, arousal probabilities, etc.) beyond basic stats.

- **SleepVST**: a Vision Transformer for sleep staging from video. This is less applicable unless we had video or infrared data (which we do not in HealthKit).

If we had a lightweight ML model that, say, takes as input the sequence of sleep stage durations or the hypnogram (sequence of 30s epoch labels) and outputs an **embedding vector or additional scores**, we can integrate it similarly to how the PAT model is integrated for activity:

- **Placement:** Add a `SleepModelService` in `clarity/ml` (like `pat_service.py` exists for the Actigraphy model). This service could load the pretrained weights (if small, possibly as a `.pt` or `.onnx` file included in the repo) or call an external service if it's large.

- **Loading and Inference:** In `HealthAnalysisPipeline.__init__`, instantiate this service on-demand (similar to `get_pat_service()`). For example:

  ```python
  from clarity.ml.sleep_model_service import SleepModelService, get_sleep_model_service
  ...
  self.sleep_model = get_sleep_model_service()  # returns either a stub or actual model
  ```

  The `sleep_model_service.py` could have a stub implementation for development that simply returns zeros or a dummy embedding for now, just to maintain structure (much like `PATModelService` has a stub in development).

- **Using the Model:** In `process_health_data`, after obtaining the SleepProcessor's statistical features, we could invoke the model:

  ```python
  if organized_data["sleep"] and self.sleep_model:
      self.logger.info("Generating sleep embedding via SleepTransformer model...")
      # Assume the model expects sleep stages time-series; we can pass the raw segments or stage sequence.
      sleep_embedding = await self.sleep_model.infer(organized_data["sleep"])
      results.processing_metadata["sleep_model_used"] = True
      results.processing_metadata["sleep_embedding_dim"] = len(sleep_embedding)
      # We could either add this embedding to the fused vector or store separately.
      # For example, add to modality_features for fusion:
      modality_features["sleep_model"] = sleep_embedding
  ```

  If the SleepTransformer outputs a vector (say 16 or 32 dimensions summarizing sleep patterns), we could include that as an additional modality or concatenate it with our 8-dim features. Simplicity-wise, we might choose one or the other to avoid double-counting sleep. Alternatively, the SleepProcessor could have a flag to use the ML model internally to refine metrics (for instance, to adjust stage percentages or estimate unseen metrics like "predicted recovery score").

- **Deployment Consideration:** If the model is heavy, we could run it as a separate microservice (similar to how the architecture allows scaling each model independently). In that case, SleepProcessor would call an API endpoint for the Sleep model service. But since the prompt says "single file, minimal dependencies", we assume a small model that can be embedded locally.

- **Maintainability:** We would keep this integration optional. For example, an environment variable or config setting could enable `USE_SLEEP_TRANSFORMER`. The default path would be the statistical pipeline (which is fast and needs no extra dependencies). If enabled, the pipeline could log that it's using the advanced model. This way, in production we can choose to deploy the more complex model as needed, and avoid burdening the system if not necessary.

- **Example Implementation of SleepModelService (stub):**

  ```python
  # File: src/clarity/ml/sleep_model_service.py
  class SleepModelService:
      def __init__(self, model_path: str = "models/sleep_transformer.onnx"):
          self.model = load_model(model_path)  # pseudo-code for loading model
      async def infer(self, sleep_metrics: list[HealthMetric]) -> list[float]:
          # Convert sleep metrics to appropriate model input (e.g., sequence of stage labels or features)
          sequence = []
          for metric in sleep_metrics:
              # e.g., create a minute-by-minute sleep stage vector or use stage proportions
              if metric.sleep_data and metric.sleep_data.sleep_stages:
                  seq = []
                  for stage, minutes in metric.sleep_data.sleep_stages.items():
                      seq.extend([stage.value] * int(minutes))  # simplistic: repeat stage code per minute
                  sequence.extend(seq)
          # Run through model (synchronously or asynchronously)
          embedding = run_inference(self.model, sequence)
          return embedding.tolist() if hasattr(embedding, "tolist") else list(embedding)
  ```

  And we'd have a `get_sleep_model_service()` similar to `get_pat_service()` to manage a singleton.

- **Using the embedding:** We might append it to `results.sleep_features` (not ideal, since that's a BaseModel for stats), or better, add `results.sleep_embedding: list[float]` in `AnalysisResults` (and in Firestore, analogous to `activity_embedding`). For fusion, we could treat it as a separate modality vector. This may require updating the fusion model to expect it or to handle a variable number of modality inputs. For simplicity, one might skip fusion and directly use the embedding in place of the 8-dim stats if the model is proven better. But often a combination of statistical and learned features can be beneficial.

Given that this is optional, a simpler path is to document how it *could* be done and possibly leave hooks. The statistical SleepProcessor ensures we have baseline insights using well-understood measures, and the transformer model could add nuance (for instance, detecting an anomaly in sleep pattern that simple stats miss, or providing an overall sleep quality score learned from large datasets).

In summary, adding a pretrained SleepTransformer is feasible: follow the pattern of PAT (loading model in a service class, calling it in the pipeline, and updating results). However, prioritize simplicity and only enable it when needed to keep the system maintainable. For now, the statistical approach gives us clarity and reliability, covering the core metrics that both clinicians and the LLM can interpret directly.
