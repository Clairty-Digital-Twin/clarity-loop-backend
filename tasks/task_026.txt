# Task ID: 26
# Title: Create FastAPI Application Entry Point
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the main.py file that serves as the entry point for the FastAPI application with proper initialization, CORS configuration, middleware setup, health check endpoint, and router inclusion.
# Details:
1. Create main.py file in the root directory of the application
2. Import necessary FastAPI modules and dependencies
3. Initialize the FastAPI application with appropriate configuration parameters
4. Configure CORS middleware with proper origins, methods, and headers
   - Allow specific origins or use wildcard for development
   - Configure allowed methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
   - Set appropriate headers and credentials policy
5. Implement custom middleware for:
   - Request/response logging
   - Authentication verification
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error handling
6. Create a health check endpoint (/health) that returns:
   - Application status
   - Version information
   - Basic system metrics
   - Database connection status
7. Set up router inclusion for all application modules:
   - Patient management routes
   - Authentication routes
   - Analytics routes
   - Integration routes
   - Admin routes
8. Implement proper application startup and shutdown event handlers
9. Configure application-wide exception handlers
10. Set up dependency injection system
11. Implement environment-specific configuration loading
12. Add documentation configuration (Swagger UI, ReDoc)
13. Configure rate limiting and security headers

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests:
   - Test FastAPI application initialization with different configurations
   - Verify CORS middleware configuration works as expected
   - Test custom middleware functionality
   - Validate health check endpoint returns correct information
   - Ensure all routers are properly included

2. Integration tests:
   - Test application startup and shutdown events
   - Verify middleware chain processes requests correctly
   - Test health check endpoint with database connection
   - Validate router inclusion by making sample requests to different endpoints
   - Test exception handling for various error scenarios

3. Manual testing:
   - Start the application using uvicorn and verify it runs without errors
   - Access the health check endpoint and confirm proper response
   - Check Swagger UI documentation at /docs endpoint
   - Verify CORS behavior with cross-origin requests
   - Test rate limiting by making rapid successive requests

4. Performance testing:
   - Measure application startup time
   - Test middleware overhead on request processing
   - Benchmark health check endpoint response time
