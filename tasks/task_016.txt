# Task ID: 16
# Title: Develop Performance Optimization and Scalability Features
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement features to ensure high performance and scalability of the system.
# Details:
1. Implement database query optimization techniques
2. Develop caching strategy with Redis
3. Set up CDN integration for static assets
4. Implement asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
5. Develop database sharding strategy
6. Implement auto-scaling for microservices
7. Develop load balancing strategy
8. Implement performance monitoring and alerting

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct performance testing of database queries
2. Verify caching effectiveness with high-load scenarios
3. Test CDN performance for global access
4. Validate asynchronous processing with various task types
5. Test database sharding with large datasets
6. Verify auto-scaling under simulated high load
7. Test load balancing with uneven traffic distribution
8. Validate performance monitoring accuracy
