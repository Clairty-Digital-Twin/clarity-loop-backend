# ðŸš€ SWARM LAUNCH INSTRUCTIONS - DO THIS EXACTLY!

## âœ… WORKTREES ARE READY! 

All 5 worktrees have been created successfully:
- âœ… pr-evaluator (on main branch)
- âœ… merge-strategist (on integration-testing)
- âœ… performance-optimizer (on performance-analysis)
- âœ… deployment-guardian (on deployment-testing)
- âœ… singularity-architect (on singularity-integration)

## ðŸ”¥ LAUNCH COMMANDS FOR EACH TERMINAL

### ðŸ“º TERMINAL 1 - PR EVALUATOR
```bash
cd /Users/ray/Desktop/CLARITY-DIGITAL-TWIN/clarity-loop-backend/.swarm-worktrees/pr-evaluator
claude
```
Then tell Claude: "Read AGENTS.md and execute your PR evaluation mission"

### ðŸ“º TERMINAL 2 - MERGE STRATEGIST
```bash
cd /Users/ray/Desktop/CLARITY-DIGITAL-TWIN/clarity-loop-backend/.swarm-worktrees/merge-strategist
claude
```
Then tell Claude: "Read AGENTS.md and create the optimal merge strategy"

### ðŸ“º TERMINAL 3 - PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZER
```bash
cd /Users/ray/Desktop/CLARITY-DIGITAL-TWIN/clarity-loop-backend/.swarm-worktrees/performance-optimizer
claude
```
Then tell Claude: "Read AGENTS.md and optimize all performance bottlenecks"

### ðŸ“º TERMINAL 4 - DEPLOYMENT GUARDIAN
```bash
cd /Users/ray/Desktop/CLARITY-DIGITAL-TWIN/clarity-loop-backend/.swarm-worktrees/deployment-guardian
claude
```
Then tell Claude: "Read AGENTS.md and ensure bulletproof deployment"

### ðŸ“º TERMINAL 5 - SINGULARITY ARCHITECT
```bash
cd /Users/ray/Desktop/CLARITY-DIGITAL-TWIN/clarity-loop-backend/.swarm-worktrees/singularity-architect
claude
```
Then tell Claude: "Read AGENTS.md and orchestrate the final singularity merge"

## ðŸŽ¯ WHAT EACH AGENT WILL DO

1. **PR-EVALUATOR**: Test all PRs and branches
2. **MERGE-STRATEGIST**: Create integration plan
3. **PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZER**: Benchmark and optimize
4. **DEPLOYMENT-GUARDIAN**: Validate deployment readiness
5. **SINGULARITY-ARCHITECT**: Final merge coordination

## ðŸŒŒ COORDINATION STRATEGY

Each agent will:
- Work independently in their worktree
- Commit findings to their branch
- Create reports in their directory
- The SINGULARITY-ARCHITECT will orchestrate the final merge

## ðŸš€ GO TIME!

Open 5 terminals and launch the agents! They'll work in parallel to achieve SINGULARITY!
