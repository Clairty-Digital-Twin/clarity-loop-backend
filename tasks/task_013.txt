# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Advanced Security Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and integrate an advanced security framework to ensure data protection and system integrity.
# Details:
1. Implement AES-256 encryption for data at rest
2. Set up TLS 1.3 for data in transit
3. Develop role-based access control system with principle of least privilege
4. Implement comprehensive security event logging and monitoring
5. Set up regular automated vulnerability scanning
6. Develop and implement incident response procedures
7. Create data classification system for sensitive information
8. Implement cross-border compliance measures for international data protection

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify encryption implementation with security audit tools
2. Test TLS 1.3 configuration with SSL/TLS testing tools
3. Conduct penetration testing on access control system
4. Verify security event logging captures all required information
5. Test vulnerability scanning with known vulnerabilities
6. Conduct simulated security incidents to test response procedures
7. Verify data classification system with sample datasets
8. Test cross-border compliance with mock international data transfers
