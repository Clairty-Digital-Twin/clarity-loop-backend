# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop AI/ML Analytics Engine Core
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core structure of the AI/ML Analytics Engine for symptom tracking and risk assessment.
# Details:
1. Set up PyTorch environment for neural network implementations
2. Implement data preprocessing pipeline for ML models
3. Develop initial symptom tracking algorithms
4. Create basic risk assessment models (suicide risk, medication compliance)
5. Implement model training and evaluation pipeline
6. Develop model versioning and management system
7. Create API endpoints for ML model predictions
8. Implement basic feature engineering techniques

# Test Strategy:
1. Test data preprocessing pipeline with sample data
2. Validate symptom tracking algorithms against known datasets
3. Evaluate risk assessment models using standard metrics
4. Test model training and evaluation pipeline
5. Verify model versioning system
6. Test API endpoints for ML model predictions
7. Implement unit tests for feature engineering techniques
