# Middleware Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
The Firebase authentication middleware was not executing because Modal was creating a new FastAPI app instance on each request using `get_app()`, which bypassed the properly configured global app instance.

## Root Cause
1. `modal_deploy_optimized.py` was calling `get_app()` which creates a **new** FastAPI instance
2. The middleware was configured on the global `app` instance during module import
3. Each request was getting a fresh app without the middleware

## Solution
Changed Modal deployment files to use the global `app` instance instead of creating new instances:

### Files Modified:

1. **modal_deploy_optimized.py**
   - Changed: `from clarity.main import get_app; return get_app()`
   - To: `from clarity.main import app; return app`

2. **modal_deploy_debug.py**
   - Same change as above

3. **src/clarity/main.py**
   - Removed duplicate app creation in the `else` block (line 111)
   - The global `app` at line 80 is now the single source of truth

4. **src/clarity/core/container.py**
   - Added debug logging to track app instance ID

## Testing
After deployment, the middleware should now:
1. Execute on every request (you'll see "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ MIDDLEWARE ACTUALLY RUNNING" in logs)
2. Properly validate Firebase tokens
3. Set `request.state.user` for authenticated requests
4. Return proper 401 errors for invalid/missing tokens

## Deploy Command
```bash
./deploy_modal_prod.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
modal deploy --env prod modal_deploy_optimized.py
```
