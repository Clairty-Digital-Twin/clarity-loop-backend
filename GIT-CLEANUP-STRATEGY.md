# ðŸ”¥ GIT CLEANUP STRATEGY - DON'T PANIC

## Current Situation

- **Main branch**: Has critical fixes merged (PR #13, #14, #18)
- **You're on**: claude/issue-5 branch (Dev Environment)
- **Multiple PRs open**: #15, #16, #17
- **Worktrees created**: In .swarm-worktrees/

## GENIUS CLEANUP PLAN

### Step 1: Clean up worktrees (they're blocking git operations)

```bash
# Remove all worktrees
git worktree list
git worktree remove .swarm-worktrees/pr-evaluator --force
git worktree remove .swarm-worktrees/merge-strategist --force
git worktree remove .swarm-worktrees/performance-optimizer --force
git worktree remove .swarm-worktrees/deployment-guardian --force
git worktree remove .swarm-worktrees/singularity-architect --force

# Or nuclear option - remove entire directory
rm -rf .swarm-worktrees
```

### Step 2: Get to a clean main branch

```bash
# After worktrees are removed
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Evaluate what we have

- **MERGED & DEPLOYED**:
  - âœ… PR #13 - Pydantic v2 fix
  - âœ… PR #14 - ML Model Management
  - âœ… PR #18 - Critical import hotfix

- **PENDING PRs** (need evaluation):
  - PR #15 - Dev Environment (removes Claude Flow)
  - PR #16 - Observability Stack
  - PR #17 - Deployment Scripts

### Step 4: Smart merge strategy

```bash
# 1. Check deployment status first
gh run list --workflow "Deploy to AWS ECS" --limit 3

# 2. If production is working, carefully evaluate each PR:
gh pr view 15  # Dev Environment - check if we want Claude Flow removed
gh pr view 16  # Observability - probably safe
gh pr view 17  # Deployment scripts - test carefully

# 3. Merge one at a time with testing
```

### Step 5: Clean up old branches

```bash
# List all remote branches
git branch -r | grep claude/

# Delete merged branches
git push origin --delete claude/issue-3-20250618_024004  # Already merged
git push origin --delete claude/issue-11-20250618_040429 # Already merged
git push origin --delete claude/issue-4-20250618_024144  # Already merged
```

## PRIORITY ACTIONS

1. **CHECK PRODUCTION** - Is it working now?

   ```bash
   curl https://clarity.novamindnyc.com/health
   ```

2. **Remove worktrees** - They're blocking everything

3. **Evaluate remaining PRs** - Don't merge blindly

4. **Test before merging** - One PR at a time

## DON'T WORRY

- Nothing is broken permanently
- We have all changes in branches
- Production should be recovering with our fixes
- We can clean this up systematically
