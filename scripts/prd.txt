Product Requirements Document: CLARITY Backend Refactoring

Project Name: CLARITY Backend Refactoring
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-01-10
Author: Ray

## Executive Summary

The CLARITY backend requires comprehensive refactoring to align with Clean Code principles and AWS best practices for 2025. The current codebase has significant technical debt with large monolithic services, low test coverage (65%), and outdated AWS implementation patterns.

## Project Goals

1. Reduce technical debt by applying Clean Code principles
2. Improve test coverage from 65% to 85%
3. Implement AWS Well-Architected Framework best practices
4. Enhance system reliability, performance, and maintainability
5. Reduce operational costs by 20% through optimization

## Current State Analysis

### Major Issues Identified:
- DynamoDBService: 998 lines (violates Single Responsibility Principle)
- PATService: 1201 lines (largest class in codebase)
- Long methods exceeding 150 lines
- Magic numbers and strings throughout codebase
- Missing AWS security best practices (Secrets Manager, KMS)
- No caching strategy or performance optimization
- Limited monitoring and observability

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Service Decomposition
- Split DynamoDBService into focused components:
  - DynamoDBConnection: Handle connection management and pooling
  - DynamoDBRepository: Implement repository pattern for data access
  - DynamoDBAuditLogger: Manage audit trails and logging
  - DynamoDBCache: Implement caching with ElastiCache/DAX
  - DynamoDBQueryBuilder: Handle query construction

- Split PATService into specialized components:
  - PATModelLoader: Manage model loading and versioning
  - PATPredictor: Handle prediction and inference
  - PATAnalyzer: Perform analysis and generate reports
  - PATMetrics: Track performance and model drift

### 2. Clean Code Implementation
- Refactor all methods to be under 50 lines
- Refactor all classes to be under 300 lines
- Replace magic numbers/strings with named constants
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions
- Apply SOLID principles throughout the codebase
- Improve naming conventions for clarity

### 3. AWS Best Practices Implementation
- Security:
  - Migrate from environment variables to AWS Secrets Manager
  - Implement KMS encryption for data at rest
  - Enable AWS WAF for API protection
  - Configure least-privilege IAM roles

- Reliability:
  - Implement circuit breakers with exponential backoff
  - Add multi-AZ deployment configuration
  - Enable AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing
  - Implement health checks and auto-recovery

- Performance:
  - Integrate ElastiCache for caching
  - Implement DynamoDB DAX for microsecond latency
  - Configure auto-scaling policies
  - Optimize Lambda cold starts

- Cost Optimization:
  - Implement S3 lifecycle policies
  - Configure DynamoDB on-demand pricing where appropriate
  - Add comprehensive cost allocation tags
  - Monitor with AWS Cost Explorer

- Operational Excellence:
  - Create custom CloudWatch metrics and dashboards
  - Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Create Systems Manager runbooks
  - Enable AWS Config for compliance

### 4. Testing Requirements
- Achieve 85% test coverage across all services
- Implement unit tests for all public methods
- Create integration tests for AWS service interactions
- Add performance benchmarks
- Implement mutation testing
- Create smoke tests for deployment validation

### 5. Monitoring and Observability
- Implement comprehensive CloudWatch metrics
- Create alerting for error rates > 1%
- Monitor API latency (target < 1 second)
- Track resource utilization
- Implement distributed tracing with X-Ray
- Create operational dashboards

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API response time < 1 second for 95th percentile
- Support 10,000 concurrent users
- Database query time < 100ms
- Cache hit rate > 80%

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Zero data loss
- Automated failover < 30 seconds
- Circuit breaker activation for downstream failures

### Security
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Regular security scans with no critical vulnerabilities
- Compliance with AWS security best practices
- Audit trail for all data modifications

### Scalability
- Auto-scale based on CPU/memory metrics
- Support 10x traffic spikes
- Horizontal scaling for all services
- Database sharding strategy

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
