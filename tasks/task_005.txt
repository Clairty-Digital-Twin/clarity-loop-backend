# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Patient Digital Twin System Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core structure for the Patient Digital Twin System, including data models and basic operations.
# Details:
1. Design patient digital twin data model
2. Implement CRUD operations for patient digital twins
3. Create endpoints for patient data management
4. Implement real-time data synchronization for patient models
5. Set up initial AI model structure for patient representation
6. Implement basic predictive modeling functionality
7. Create data anonymization and encryption mechanisms
8. Set up integration points with EHR/EMR systems

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for patient digital twin CRUD operations
2. Test real-time synchronization of patient data
3. Verify data anonymization and encryption mechanisms
4. Implement integration tests with mock EHR/EMR systems
5. Test basic predictive modeling functionality
