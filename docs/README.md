## üîç What CLARITY Does

```
Your Apple Watch Data ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Conversational Health Insights
```

**Input**: HealthKit exports (heart rate, sleep, activity, HRV)  
**Processing**: PAT transformer + Google Gemini AI  
**Output**: Natural language health insights you can chat with

### Example Interaction
```
User: "Why do I feel tired even with 8 hours of sleep?"

CLARITY: "Your sleep efficiency was only 73% last week due to frequent 
awakenings between 2-4 AM. Your HRV data suggests elevated stress levels 
during this period. Consider reducing screen time before bed and trying 
a consistent wind-down routine."
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

**Backend**: Python FastAPI with Clean Architecture  
**AI Models**: Custom PAT transformer + Google Gemini  
**Infrastructure**: AWS (ECS, DynamoDB, Cognito, S3)  
**Data Pipeline**: Real-time processing with WebSocket support

### Core Components
- **Data Ingestion**: HealthKit JSON processing
- **PAT Analysis**: 7-day activity pattern analysis  
- **Gemini Integration**: Natural language insight generation
- **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket-based AI conversations
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerts
