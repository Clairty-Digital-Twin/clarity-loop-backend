# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Advanced Security Testing and Penetration Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and integrate an advanced security testing framework including automated and manual penetration testing.
# Details:
1. Set up automated vulnerability scanning with OWASP ZAP
2. Implement static application security testing (SAST)
3. Develop dynamic application security testing (DAST) processes
4. Create framework for regular manual penetration testing
5. Implement security fuzz testing
6. Develop secure code review processes
7. Create security testing reports and dashboards
8. Implement continuous security monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify OWASP ZAP integration and scanning
2. Validate SAST tool findings with manual code review
3. Test DAST processes with intentionally vulnerable endpoints
4. Conduct mock penetration testing exercises
5. Verify fuzz testing uncovers potential vulnerabilities
6. Review secure code review findings
7. Validate security testing reports for completeness
8. Test continuous security monitoring alerts
