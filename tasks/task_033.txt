# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement PAT (Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer) Model Service
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 15, 17, 29, 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a production-ready service that loads the Dartmouth PAT model weights and provides real-time actigraphy analysis endpoints, integrating with the health data service.
# Details:
1. Set up a dedicated module for the PAT model service (e.g., `pat_service.py`)
2. Implement model loading functionality:
   - Load the Dartmouth PAT model weights from the `/models/` directory
   - Use appropriate deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) for model instantiation
   - Implement error handling for missing or corrupt model files
3. Create a preprocessing pipeline:
   - Implement data normalization and standardization
   - Handle time series data formatting (e.g., sliding window approach)
   - Ensure compatibility with the model's expected input format
4. Develop inference capabilities:
   - Create an asynchronous inference function using FastAPI
   - Implement batching for efficient processing of multiple requests
   - Optimize inference speed using techniques like ONNX runtime or TensorRT if applicable
5. Integrate with the health data service:
   - Implement an API endpoint for real-time actigraphy analysis
   - Ensure secure data transfer between services
   - Handle authentication and authorization using the existing Firebase Authentication system
6. Implement result post-processing:
   - Convert model outputs to clinically relevant metrics
   - Format results in compliance with HL7 FHIR standards
7. Develop caching mechanism for frequent requests:
   - Implement Redis or a similar in-memory data store for caching
   - Set up cache invalidation strategies
8. Implement logging and monitoring:
   - Log model inputs, outputs, and performance metrics
   - Integrate with the existing logging and monitoring system
9. Ensure HIPAA compliance:
   - Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Ensure all data handling complies with HIPAA regulations
10. Develop comprehensive error handling:
    - Handle various error scenarios (e.g., invalid input, model failure)
    - Implement graceful degradation strategies
11. Optimize for scalability:
    - Implement load balancing for multiple model instances
    - Consider containerization for easy deployment and scaling
12. Document the API and usage guidelines for other developers

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests:
   - Test model loading function with various scenarios (valid weights, missing files, corrupt files)
   - Verify preprocessing pipeline with sample inputs
   - Test inference function with mock model and inputs
   - Ensure proper error handling for edge cases

2. Integration tests:
   - Test end-to-end flow from API request to response
   - Verify correct integration with health data service
   - Test authentication and authorization with Firebase
   - Ensure FHIR compliance of output data

3. Performance tests:
   - Measure inference time for various input sizes
   - Test system under high concurrency to ensure scalability
   - Verify caching mechanism improves response times

4. Security tests:
   - Perform penetration testing on the API endpoints
   - Verify data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Ensure compliance with HIPAA requirements

5. Functional tests:
   - Validate accuracy of actigraphy analysis against known datasets
   - Test with various types of actigraphy data (e.g., different devices, sampling rates)
   - Verify correct handling of time zones and daylight saving time

6. Regression tests:
   - Ensure new implementation doesn't break existing functionality
   - Verify compatibility with other system components

7. Load tests:
   - Simulate high traffic scenarios to test system stability
   - Measure and optimize resource utilization under load

8. Monitoring and logging tests:
   - Verify all required metrics and logs are captured
   - Test alert mechanisms for critical errors or performance issues

9. Compliance tests:
   - Conduct a HIPAA compliance audit
   - Verify all regulatory requirements are met

10. User acceptance testing:
    - Engage with clinicians to validate the clinical relevance of the analysis
    - Gather feedback on the API usability from other developers
