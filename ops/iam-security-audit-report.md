# IAM Security Audit Report - CLARITY Platform

**Date:** December 17, 2024  
**Auditor:** Security Team  
**Status:** CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required

## Executive Summary

The CLARITY platform's IAM configuration poses significant security risks due to overly permissive policies. Current roles violate the principle of least privilege, potentially exposing sensitive health data and infrastructure to unauthorized access.

## Current State Analysis

### Active IAM Roles

1. **ecsTaskExecutionRole** (ECS service execution)
   - Used by: ECS to pull images and manage containers
   - Current permissions: TOO BROAD

2. **clarity-backend-task-role** (Application runtime)
   - Used by: Running application containers
   - Current permissions: CRITICALLY OVER-PERMISSIVE

### Security Vulnerabilities Identified

#### üö® CRITICAL Issues

1. **Unrestricted S3 Access**
   - Both roles have `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`
   - Can read ANY S3 bucket in the account
   - Risk: Data exposure, credential theft

2. **Full DynamoDB Access**
   - `clarity-backend-task-role` has `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`
   - Can create/delete ANY table
   - Can read/write to ANY table
   - Risk: Data corruption, unauthorized access

3. **Cognito PowerUser Access**
   - Can manage ANY user pool
   - Can create/delete users in any pool
   - Risk: Authentication bypass, user impersonation

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE Issues

1. **Duplicate Secrets Policies**
   - `ecsTaskExecutionRole` has overlapping inline policies
   - Unclear permission boundaries

2. **No Resource Constraints**
   - Policies use wildcards instead of specific ARNs
   - No condition statements for additional security

## Resource Inventory

### Actual Resources Used
- **S3 Buckets:** 2 (clarity-health-data-storage, clarity-ml-models-*)
- **DynamoDB Tables:** 1 active (clarity-health-data)
- **Secrets:** 2 (gemini-api-key, cognito-config)
- **Cognito Pool:** 1 (us-east-1_efXaR5EcP)

### Permissions vs. Actual Usage
- Can access: ALL S3 buckets
- Actually need: 2 specific buckets
- Can access: ALL DynamoDB tables
- Actually need: 1 specific table
- Can manage: ALL Cognito pools
- Actually need: 1 specific pool

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Current State | Impact | Likelihood | Priority |
|------|--------------|--------|------------|----------|
| Data Breach | Full S3 access | HIGH | MEDIUM | CRITICAL |
| Data Loss | Full DynamoDB access | HIGH | MEDIUM | CRITICAL |
| Auth Bypass | Cognito PowerUser | HIGH | LOW | HIGH |
| Compliance | Over-permissions | MEDIUM | HIGH | HIGH |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Replace AWS Managed Policies** with custom least-privilege policies
2. **Implement Resource-Level Permissions** for all services
3. **Add Condition Statements** where applicable
4. **Enable CloudTrail Monitoring** for all IAM actions
5. **Set Up Permission Boundaries** for role assumption

### Proposed Policy Changes

See `iam-least-privilege-policies.json` for detailed replacement policies.

## Compliance Impact

- **HIPAA:** Current permissions violate minimum necessary standard
- **SOC2:** Fails least-privilege control requirements
- **ISO 27001:** Non-compliant with access control policies

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1:** Test new policies in staging
- **Week 2:** Deploy to production with monitoring
- **Week 3:** Audit and refine based on usage
- **Week 4:** Final review and documentation

## Conclusion

The current IAM configuration represents a critical security vulnerability that must be addressed immediately. The proposed least-privilege policies will significantly reduce attack surface while maintaining full application functionality.
