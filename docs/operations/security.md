## üö® Current Security Risks

### High Priority

1. **No field-level encryption** - PII stored in plaintext
2. **No security monitoring** - Blind to attacks
3. **Basic secrets management** - Using environment variables
4. **No DynamoDB encryption at rest** - Data stored unencrypted in database

### Medium Priority

1. **No rate limiting** - Vulnerable to abuse
2. **Incomplete MFA** - Only framework implemented
3. **No audit logging** - Cannot track data access
4. **No vulnerability scanning** - Unknown security holes

### Low Priority

1. **No social login** - Less convenient for users
2. **Basic session management** - Could be more sophisticated
3. **No SIEM integration** - Manual log analysis only

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing to Security

Security improvements are welcome! Priority areas for contribution:

### Immediate Needs

1. **Security headers middleware** (HTTPS enforcement already handled by AWS ALB)

   ```python
   # Example middleware needed
   @app.middleware("http")
   async def add_security_headers(request: Request, call_next):
       # Add HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options headers
       # HTTPS redirect handled by AWS ALB
   ```

2. **Rate limiting implementation**

   ```python
   # Need rate limiting per user/IP
   from slowapi import Limiter
   ```

3. **Security headers middleware**

   ```python
   # HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
   ```

### How to Contribute

1. Pick a security feature from the "Not Yet Implemented" list
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement with tests
4. Update this document
5. Submit PR with security review

### Security Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak info
- [ ] Logging doesn't include PII
- [ ] Tests cover security cases
- [ ] Documentation updated
