# Clarity Digital Twin Demo Data

**Generated:** `{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}`

This directory contains comprehensive synthetic data for demonstrating the Clarity Digital Twin platform to potential cofounders and stakeholders.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Demo Scenarios**

### 1. **Apple HealthKit Integration Demo**
**Location:** `healthkit/`  
**Purpose:** Showcase mature HealthKit data ingestion and natural language chat interface

**Key Components:**
- `users.json` - 3 synthetic user profiles with varied demographics
- `health_metrics.json` - 63 realistic health data points across 7 days
- `activities.json` - 49 activity records (walking, running, sleep, etc.)
- `predictions.json` - 9 PAT model predictions and analysis results
- `reports.json` - 3 comprehensive health analysis reports

**Demo Flow:**
1. Load user profile: "Meet Sarah, our health-conscious user..."
2. Show rich HealthKit data: Sleep patterns, activity levels, heart rate
3. Demonstrate chat interface: "What can you tell me about my sleep quality this week?"
4. Show AI-powered insights and personalized recommendations

### 2. **Bipolar Risk Detection System**
**Location:** `clinical/`  
**Purpose:** Early warning system for mood episodes with clinical-grade accuracy

**Key Components:**
- `baseline_scenario.json` - 30 days of normal baseline patterns
- `prodromal_scenario.json` - 14 days of early warning signs
- `acute_manic_scenario.json` - 7 days of acute episode data
- `recovery_scenario.json` - 21 days of recovery phase
- `complete_episode_scenario.json` - Full 72-day episode timeline

**Demo Flow:**
1. Show baseline: "Here's what normal looks like for this patient..."
2. Highlight prodromal phase: "Notice the sleep disruption starting 2 weeks before..."
3. Show acute phase: "Risk score jumps to 0.9 - clinical intervention needed"
4. Recovery tracking: "Monitoring return to baseline patterns"

### 3. **Multi-Modal Chat Interface**
**Location:** `chat/`  
**Purpose:** Natural language interaction with personal health data

**Personas Available:**
- `health_conscious/` - Fitness enthusiast asking optimization questions
- `clinical_patient/` - Patient seeking guidance on mood patterns

**Components per Persona:**
- `conversation_starters.json` - Natural opening questions
- `followup_questions.json` - Contextual follow-ups
- `response_templates.json` - AI response patterns
- `demo_conversations.json` - Complete conversation examples
