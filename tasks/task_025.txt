# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement System-wide Error Handling and Resilience Features
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 8, 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive error handling mechanisms and implement features to enhance system resilience and fault tolerance.
# Details:
1. Implement global error handling middleware
2. Develop circuit breaker patterns for external service calls
3. Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
4. Create fallback strategies for critical system components
5. Develop chaos engineering framework for resilience testing
6. Implement graceful degradation mechanisms
7. Create automated system health checks and self-healing processes
8. Develop comprehensive system status dashboard

# Test Strategy:
1. Test global error handling with various error scenarios
2. Verify circuit breaker functionality with simulated service failures
3. Test retry mechanisms under different network conditions
4. Validate fallback strategies for critical components
5. Conduct chaos engineering experiments in test environment
6. Test graceful degradation under high load or component failure
7. Verify self-healing processes with simulated issues
8. Validate system status dashboard accuracy and responsiveness
