# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY RECOVERY PLAN - SENIOR ENGINEER APPROACH

## SITUATION ASSESSMENT

- **Production is DOWN** since ~3 hours ago
- **All deployments failing** due to import errors
- **Too many PRs** creating confusion
- **Multiple "fixes" not working**

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Option 1: Fix Forward (10 minutes)

1. Check if PR #20 passes CI
2. If YES: Merge it and deploy
3. If NO: Go to Option 2

### Option 2: REVERT TO STABLE (Recommended)

We need to go back to the last known working state.

```bash
# 1. Find the last working deployment
# Based on git history, commit 941513e was before all the Claude changes

# 2. Create revert branch
git checkout -b emergency-revert origin/main
git revert --no-commit ffe3ac2..HEAD
git commit -m "EMERGENCY: Revert to stable state before Claude changes"

# 3. Force push to main (with team approval)
git push origin emergency-revert:main --force-with-lease
```

### Option 3: NUCLEAR RESET

If reverting is too complex:

```bash
# Reset to known good commit
git checkout 941513e
git checkout -b stable-recovery
git push origin stable-recovery:main --force-with-lease
```

## WHAT WENT WRONG

1. **Too Many Automated Changes** - Claude created 10+ branches/PRs
2. **Import Pattern Issues** - TYPE_CHECKING blocks breaking runtime
3. **No Testing Between Merges** - Merged multiple PRs without testing
4. **Cascading Failures** - Each "fix" revealed more issues

## PROPER FIX APPROACH

### Step 1: Stabilize

- Get ANYTHING working in production
- Even if it means reverting everything

### Step 2: Test Locally

```bash
# Test the current main
SKIP_EXTERNAL_SERVICES=true python -m clarity.main

# If it fails, we MUST revert
```

### Step 3: Incremental Changes

- ONE PR at a time
- Test locally
- Deploy to staging
- Monitor for 30 min
- Then production

## LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Don't merge multiple AI-generated PRs** without human review
2. **Test locally first** - always
3. **Have a rollback plan** - always
4. **One change at a time** in production

## DECISION TIME

You have 3 options:

1. Wait 5 more minutes for PR #20 to pass
2. Revert everything to stable
3. Nuclear reset to last known good

As a senior engineer, I recommend **Option 2: REVERT** because:

- Production has been down too long
- Too many unknowns with the fixes
- Need to restore service ASAP
- Can re-apply changes carefully later
