# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 Pro Integration Service
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 15, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Complete the implementation of the existing service that connects to Google's Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 Pro model for generating human-like health insights and narratives, including prompt engineering and integration with the analysis pipeline. Current service has basic structure with models and interfaces defined but requires actual Vertex AI integration and has 0% test coverage in the ML module.
# Details:
1. Review existing service structure, models, and interfaces to understand current implementation
   - HealthInsightRequest/Response models are already defined with proper types
   - GeminiService class has a clear interface structure
   - Core methods have TODOs for actual implementation
2. Complete the Google Cloud project setup and enable Vertex AI API
3. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK and Vertex AI client library
4. Enhance the existing GeminiService class with functional methods for:
   - Implementing the initialize() method with vertexai.init() and proper client setup
   - Replacing placeholder logic in generate_health_insights() with real Gemini API calls
   - Processing and formatting responses
5. Develop prompt engineering templates for health data interpretation:
   - Create a base prompt template for general health insights
   - Develop specialized templates for different types of health data (e.g., vitals, lab results, medications)
   - Test and refine prompts for optimal results
6. Implement response parsing and formatting:
   - Extract key insights from the model's response
   - Structure the insights into a consistent format for the frontend
7. Complete integration with the existing analysis pipeline:
   - Utilize the existing interface to receive processed health data
   - Implement logic to select appropriate prompt templates based on data type
   - Send prompts to Vertex AI and receive responses
8. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls
9. Set up caching for frequently requested insights to improve performance
10. Implement comprehensive logging for all API interactions and generated insights
11. Complete the configuration system for managing API keys, model parameters, and prompt templates
12. Develop a rate limiting system to manage API usage and costs
13. Ensure HIPAA-compliant data handling practices:
    - Ensure all data sent to and received from Vertex AI is properly encrypted
    - Implement data anonymization before sending to the model
    - Set up secure storage for generated insights
14. Create unit tests to achieve comprehensive test coverage:
    - Test all GeminiService class methods
    - Test prompt template generation
    - Test response parsing and formatting
    - Test error handling and retry mechanisms
    - Aim for >90% test coverage (currently at 0% for ML module)
15. Develop integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality
16. Implement a fallback mechanism for when the Vertex AI service is unavailable
17. Create documentation for the service, including API usage, configuration, and best practices
18. Perform a final code review to ensure all requirements for the Gemini vertical slice are met

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing (Priority - High):
   - Test GeminiService class methods in isolation
   - Verify prompt template generation for different health data types
   - Test response parsing and formatting functions
   - Validate error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Aim for >90% test coverage of all service components (currently at 0%)

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up a test environment with mock health data
   - Verify end-to-end flow from receiving health data to generating insights
   - Test integration with the existing analysis pipeline
   - Validate proper handling of different data types and edge cases

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure response times for insight generation
   - Test caching mechanism effectiveness
   - Verify rate limiting functionality

4. Security Testing:
   - Audit data anonymization process
   - Verify encryption of data in transit and at rest
   - Test HIPAA compliance measures

5. API Testing:
   - Verify correct API calls to Vertex AI
   - Test API key management and rotation
   - Create mock responses to test various scenarios

6. Error Handling:
   - Simulate various error conditions (network issues, API limits, etc.)
   - Verify fallback mechanisms work as expected

7. Load Testing:
   - Simulate high concurrent requests to the service
   - Verify system stability under load

8. Compliance Testing:
   - Review generated insights for medical accuracy (involve medical professionals)
   - Ensure all logging and data storage comply with regulatory requirements

9. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Involve stakeholders to review the quality and relevance of generated insights
   - Gather feedback on the usefulness of the service in the overall system

10. Continuous Monitoring:
    - Set up alerts for abnormal API usage or error rates
    - Regularly review logs and performance metrics

11. Vertical Slice Testing:
    - Verify that the Gemini service works correctly as part of the complete vertical slice
    - Test the service in the context of the full application flow with the existing API infrastructure
