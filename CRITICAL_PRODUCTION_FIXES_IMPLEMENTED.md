# Critical Production Fixes Implemented

## Date: 2025-07-12

This document summarizes the critical production fixes implemented for the mania risk module.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Always Emit mania_risk Stub ✅

**Issue**: The API was inconsistent - mania_risk was only included in health_indicators when the feature was enabled, causing client-side errors.

**Fix**: Modified `analysis_pipeline.py` to ALWAYS include mania_risk in the health_indicators response with default values when disabled:

```python
# ALWAYS add mania_risk to health_indicators for API consistency
results.summary_stats.setdefault("health_indicators", {})
results.summary_stats["health_indicators"]["mania_risk"] = mania_risk_data
```

Default values when disabled:
```json
{
  "risk_score": 0.0,
  "alert_level": "none",
  "contributing_factors": [],
  "confidence": 0.0
}
```

### 2. Fix Model Integrity Check Security Vulnerability ✅

**Issue**: PAT model was being loaded even after checksum verification failed, creating a security vulnerability.

**Fix**: Modified `pat_service.py` to:
1. Check model integrity BEFORE creating the model instance
2. Raise RuntimeError immediately if integrity check fails
3. Set model to None and is_loaded to False on any failure

```python
# SECURITY: Verify model integrity BEFORE creating model
if Path(self.model_path).exists():
    if not self._verify_model_integrity():
        error_msg = (
            f"Model integrity verification FAILED for {self.model_path}. "
            f"Refusing to load potentially tampered model."
        )
        logger.error(error_msg)
        raise RuntimeError(error_msg)
```

### 3. Implement Proper Feature Flag Architecture ✅

**Issue**: No centralized feature flag system existed, making it difficult to control features in production.

**Fix**: Created a comprehensive feature flag system in `src/clarity/core/feature_flags.py`:

**Features**:
- Environment-based configuration (integrates with MANIA_RISK_ENABLED env var)
- Support for multiple flag states: ENABLED, DISABLED, BETA, CANARY
- Beta user access control
- Gradual canary rollout with percentage-based deployment
- Result caching for performance
- Graceful error handling
- Decorator support for feature-flagged functions

**Usage**:
```python
from clarity.core.feature_flags import is_feature_enabled

if is_feature_enabled("mania_risk_analysis", user_id=user_id):
    # Run mania risk analysis
else:
    # Use default values
```

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests in:
- `tests/core/test_feature_flags.py` - Feature flag system tests
- `tests/ml/test_mania_risk_production_fixes.py` - Production fix integration tests

All tests are passing and verify:
1. mania_risk is always included in API responses
2. Model integrity checks prevent loading untrusted models
3. Feature flags properly control mania risk analysis
4. Graceful degradation when mania analysis fails

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set `MANIA_RISK_ENABLED=true` to enable mania risk analysis
   - Default is `false` for safety

2. **Feature Flag Control**:
   - Can enable/disable mania risk per user via beta users list
   - Can use canary rollout for gradual deployment
   - Enhanced security flag is auto-enabled in production

3. **Security**:
   - Model integrity verification is mandatory
   - Failed integrity checks block model loading completely
   - All failures are logged for audit trail

## Monitoring

Monitor these log messages in production:
- "Model integrity verification FAILED" - Critical security alert
- "Mania risk analysis failed for user" - Feature degradation
- "Mania risk analysis disabled for user via feature flag" - Normal operation

## Future Enhancements

1. Add feature flag UI for runtime control
2. Implement A/B testing framework on top of feature flags
3. Add metrics collection for feature usage
4. Implement remote feature flag configuration (e.g., LaunchDarkly integration)
