# Bipolar Risk Score Weight Rationale

## Overview
This document provides the clinical rationale and literature sources for each weight used in our rule-based bipolar risk screening system. These weights are **provisional heuristics** based on clinical literature and will be recalibrated once we have labeled episode data.

## Weight Sources and Rationale

### Sleep-Related Weights

#### severe_sleep_loss: 0.45
**Source**: Harvey et al. (2005) Sleep Medicine Reviews
- 40-50% of manic episodes preceded by sleep loss < 3 hours
- Strongest single predictor in multiple studies
- **Rationale**: Given its strong association, we assign highest weight

#### acute_sleep_loss: 0.25  
**Source**: Wehr et al. (1987) Archives of General Psychiatry
- Sleep reduction 5-7 hours associated with hypomania in 25% of cases
- **Rationale**: Moderate risk indicator, lower weight than severe

#### rapid_sleep_onset: 0.10
**Source**: Clinical observation (no specific study)
- Sleep latency < 5 min can indicate exhaustion or mania
- **Rationale**: Weak indicator alone, needs other symptoms

### Circadian Rhythm Weights

#### circadian_phase_advance: 0.40
**Source**: Wehr et al. (2018) Bipolar Disorders journal
- Phase advance (earlier sleep) preceded 65% of manic episodes
- Median advance: 1.5-2 hours
- **Rationale**: Strong predictor, nearly as important as sleep loss

#### circadian_phase_delay: 0.35
**Source**: Geoffroy et al. (2014) Journal of Affective Disorders  
- Phase delay associated with depressive episodes in 60% of cases
- **Rationale**: Important for depression detection

#### circadian_disruption: 0.20
**Source**: Murray & Harvey (2010) Bipolar Disorders
- General rhythm instability in 80% of BD patients
- **Rationale**: Common but non-specific, moderate weight

#### sleep_inconsistency: 0.15
**Source**: Bauer et al. (2006) Bipolar Disorders
- Sleep variability > 2hr associated with mood instability
- **Rationale**: Early warning sign, lower weight

### Activity Weights

#### activity_surge: 0.15
**Source**: DSM-5 Criterion B1 - Increased goal-directed activity
- Core diagnostic criterion for mania
- **Rationale**: Clear indicator but needs sustained pattern

#### activity_fragmentation: 0.20
**Source**: Merikangas et al. (2019) JAMA Psychiatry
- Irregular activity patterns in prodromal phase
- **Rationale**: Early indicator of dysregulation

#### activity_variability_spike: 0.35
**Source**: Ortiz et al. (2021) - approximated from description
- Variability increases 7 days before episodes
- **Rationale**: Strong early warning signal

### Physiological Weights

#### elevated_hr: 0.05
**Source**: Clinical observation
- Sympathetic activation during mania
- **Rationale**: Weak standalone indicator

#### low_hrv: 0.05
**Source**: Faurholt-Jepsen et al. (2017) International Journal of Bipolar Disorders
- HRV reduction in mood episodes
- **Rationale**: Non-specific stress indicator

### Deviation from Personal Baseline

#### sleep_deviation: 0.20
#### activity_deviation: 0.20  
#### circadian_deviation: 0.25
**Source**: Bauer et al. (2008) Bipolar Disorders
- Individual baseline deviations more predictive than absolute values
- **Rationale**: Personalization improves detection

## Important Notes

1. **These weights are PROVISIONAL** - not statistically validated
2. **Based on effect sizes** from literature, not optimization
3. **Will be recalibrated** with n>50 labeled episodes
4. **Directionality matters more than exact values** for now

## Validation Plan

1. Collect clinician-verified episode labels (target: 50+)
2. Run logistic regression to learn optimal weights
3. Compare AUROC: heuristic vs learned weights
4. Document improvement and update this file
