# CLARITY Digital Twin Platform - System Dossier

## Executive Summary

CLARITY is a sophisticated health data platform that creates a "digital twin" of users by processing wearable device data (primarily Apple Watch/HealthKit) and providing AI-powered health insights. The system has recently been migrated from Google Cloud Platform (Firebase/Firestore) to AWS infrastructure.

**Status**: Backend is functionally complete with 807/810 tests passing (99.6% pass rate), but requires deployment validation and increased test coverage (currently 57%, target 85%).

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Purpose

1. **Health Data Aggregation**: Collect and store health metrics from wearable devices
2. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Process health data using machine learning models including:
   - Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT) for movement analysis
   - Google Gemini for natural language health insights
   - Custom ML pipelines for sleep, activity, and cardiovascular analysis
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket support for live health data streaming
4. **Personalized Insights**: Generate actionable health recommendations based on user data

### Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.12)
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS
  - Authentication: AWS Cognito
  - Database: DynamoDB
  - Storage: S3
  - Messaging: SQS/SNS
  - Deployment: ECS with Docker
- **AI/ML**:
  - Google Gemini API for insights
  - Custom transformers for actigraphy
  - NumPy/Pandas for data processing
- **Real-time**: WebSockets with connection management
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards

3. **Activity Data**: Steps, calories, distance, exercise minutes
4. **Mental Health**: Mood scores, stress levels, mindfulness minutes
5. **Respiratory**: Breathing rate, respiratory patterns
6. **Glucose**: Blood glucose readings (for diabetic users)

### Processing Pipeline

## Current State Audit

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Complete AWS Migration**: Successfully migrated from GCP/Firebase
2. **Robust Test Suite**: 807 passing tests with comprehensive coverage
3. **Clean Architecture**: Follows Clean Architecture/SOLID principles
4. **Modular Design**: Well-separated concerns with ports/adapters pattern
5. **AI Integration**: Multiple AI services integrated (Gemini, PAT)
6. **Real-time Capable**: WebSocket infrastructure in place
7. **Security**: JWT auth with Cognito, role-based permissions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns

1. **Test Coverage**: 57% is below industry standard (target 85%)
2. **Unused Services**: Several AWS services not fully implemented:
   - `sqs_messaging_service.py` (0% coverage)
   - `s3_storage_service.py` (17% coverage)
   - `cognito_auth_service.py` (16% coverage)
3. **Configuration Complexity**: Multiple config files for AWS deployment
4. **Incomplete Features**: Some endpoints may not be fully functional
5. **Documentation**: Limited API documentation and usage examples

### üîç Reality Check

**What's Actually Working:**

- Core health data upload/retrieval
- Basic authentication flow
- Mock services for development
- WebSocket connections
- Database operations (via mocks in tests)

**What Needs Verification:**

- AWS service integrations (Cognito, DynamoDB, S3)
- Gemini API integration
- PAT model inference
- Real-time data streaming
- Production deployment configuration

## Professional Recommendations

### Immediate Priority Order

1. **Local Docker Validation** (2-4 hours)

   ```bash
   docker build -t clarity-backend .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 clarity-backend
   # Test core endpoints locally
   ```

2. **AWS Deployment Test** (4-8 hours)
   - Deploy to AWS ECS staging environment
   - Verify all AWS service connections
   - Test with real AWS services (not mocks)
   - Document any configuration issues

3. **Integration Testing** (1-2 days)
   - Create end-to-end tests for critical paths:
     - User registration ‚Üí login ‚Üí upload data ‚Üí get insights
     - HealthKit upload ‚Üí PAT analysis ‚Üí results retrieval
   - Test with actual Gemini API calls
   - Verify WebSocket functionality

4. **Increase Test Coverage** (2-3 days)
   - Focus on untested AWS services
   - Add integration tests for external services
   - Target 85% coverage for production readiness

5. **Documentation** (1 day)
   - API usage examples
   - Deployment guide
   - Configuration documentation
   - Client integration guide

### Deployment Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Action | Risk Level |
|----------|--------|------------|
| All endpoints work locally | Proceed to AWS staging | Low |
| Core endpoints work, some features fail | Deploy core, iterate on features | Medium |
| Major failures locally | Fix before deployment | High |
| AWS services fail | Debug configuration | Medium |

### Next Immediate Steps

1. **Run Local Docker Test** (NOW)

   ```bash
   # Build and run
   docker-compose up --build
   
   # Test health endpoint
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   
   # Test auth flow
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@test.com", "password": "testpass123"}'
   ```

2. **Create Smoke Test Script**
   - Test each major endpoint group
   - Verify response formats
   - Check error handling

3. **AWS Staging Deployment**
   - Use existing ECS task definitions
   - Monitor CloudWatch logs
   - Verify service connectivity

## Conclusion

CLARITY is an ambitious health data platform with sophisticated ML capabilities. The codebase is well-structured and has passed the critical migration from GCP to AWS. The 99.6% test pass rate indicates the core logic is sound, but the low coverage suggests many code paths are untested, particularly AWS service integrations.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with local Docker testing immediately to validate functionality, then deploy to AWS staging. The platform appears ready for controlled testing but needs integration validation before production use.

**Estimated Timeline to Production**:

- Optimistic: 1 week (if AWS services work as expected)
- Realistic: 2-3 weeks (allowing for debugging and coverage increase)
- Conservative: 1 month (full testing and documentation)
