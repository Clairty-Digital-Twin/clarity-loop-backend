### AI Foundation Models for Wearable Movement Data in Mental Health Research

**File**: `AI Foundation Models for Wearable Movement Data in Mental.pdf`  
**Authors**: Nicholas C. Jacobson, Stephanie D. Comer, et al.  
**Published**: 2024  
**ArXiv**: 2411.15240  
**DOI**: [Pending publication]

#### Abstract Summary

This paper introduces the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), a foundation model for analyzing wearable movement data in mental health research. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in:

- **Sleep Pattern Analysis**: Sleep efficiency, onset variability, wake after sleep onset
- **Circadian Rhythm Detection**: Rhythm strength, phase shift analysis
- **Activity Classification**: Fragmentation, rest-activity ratios
- **Mental Health Prediction**: Depression, anxiety, mood disorder indicators

#### Key Technical Contributions

1. **Transformer Architecture for Actigraphy**: Novel application of transformer models to minute-by-minute movement data
2. **Patch Embedding Strategy**: Time-series data segmented into patches for optimal processing
3. **Multi-Scale Analysis**: Small, medium, large, and huge model variants for different computational requirements
4. **Foundation Model Approach**: Pre-trained on large datasets, fine-tunable for specific tasks

#### Implementation Relevance
