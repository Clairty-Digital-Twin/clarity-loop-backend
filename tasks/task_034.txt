# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 Pro Integration Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 15, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a service that connects to Google's Vertex AI Gemini 2.5 Pro model for generating human-like health insights and narratives, including prompt engineering and integration with the analysis pipeline.
# Details:
1. Set up Google Cloud project and enable Vertex AI API
2. Install and configure Google Cloud SDK and Vertex AI client library
3. Implement a VertexAIService class with methods for:
   - Initializing the Vertex AI client
   - Sending prompts to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model
   - Processing and formatting responses
4. Develop prompt engineering templates for health data interpretation:
   - Create a base prompt template for general health insights
   - Develop specialized templates for different types of health data (e.g., vitals, lab results, medications)
5. Implement response parsing and formatting:
   - Extract key insights from the model's response
   - Structure the insights into a consistent format for the frontend
6. Integrate with the existing analysis pipeline:
   - Create an interface to receive processed health data
   - Implement logic to select appropriate prompt templates based on data type
   - Send prompts to Vertex AI and receive responses
7. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls
8. Set up caching for frequently requested insights to improve performance
9. Implement logging for all API interactions and generated insights
10. Create a configuration system for managing API keys, model parameters, and prompt templates
11. Develop a rate limiting system to manage API usage and costs
12. Implement HIPAA-compliant data handling practices:
    - Ensure all data sent to and received from Vertex AI is properly encrypted
    - Implement data anonymization before sending to the model
    - Set up secure storage for generated insights
13. Create unit tests for each component of the service
14. Develop integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality
15. Implement a fallback mechanism for when the Vertex AI service is unavailable
16. Create documentation for the service, including API usage, configuration, and best practices

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test VertexAIService class methods in isolation
   - Verify prompt template generation for different health data types
   - Test response parsing and formatting functions
   - Validate error handling and retry mechanisms

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up a test environment with mock health data
   - Verify end-to-end flow from receiving health data to generating insights
   - Test integration with the existing analysis pipeline
   - Validate proper handling of different data types and edge cases

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure response times for insight generation
   - Test caching mechanism effectiveness
   - Verify rate limiting functionality

4. Security Testing:
   - Audit data anonymization process
   - Verify encryption of data in transit and at rest
   - Test HIPAA compliance measures

5. API Testing:
   - Verify correct API calls to Vertex AI
   - Test API key management and rotation

6. Error Handling:
   - Simulate various error conditions (network issues, API limits, etc.)
   - Verify fallback mechanisms work as expected

7. Load Testing:
   - Simulate high concurrent requests to the service
   - Verify system stability under load

8. Compliance Testing:
   - Review generated insights for medical accuracy (involve medical professionals)
   - Ensure all logging and data storage comply with regulatory requirements

9. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Involve stakeholders to review the quality and relevance of generated insights
   - Gather feedback on the usefulness of the service in the overall system

10. Continuous Monitoring:
    - Set up alerts for abnormal API usage or error rates
    - Regularly review logs and performance metrics
