# üîó CLARITY Epic Integration: Psychiatric Digital Twins in Clinical Practice

## Overview

CLARITY's Epic integration transforms mental health care by embedding **objective, continuous psychiatric monitoring** directly into Epic's clinical workflows. Using the breakthrough PAT (Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer) model, we deliver real-time depression risk prediction, sleep pattern analysis, and digital biomarkers for mental health‚Äîall seamlessly integrated into Epic's 350+ million patient ecosystem.
