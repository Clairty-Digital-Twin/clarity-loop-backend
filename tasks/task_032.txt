# Task ID: 32
# Title: Configure Environment and Docker Setup for Development and Deployment
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 26, 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create Docker configuration for local development environment and Cloud Run deployment, including containerization of the FastAPI application with appropriate environment configurations.
# Details:
1. Create a multi-stage Dockerfile in the project root:
   - Development stage with debugging tools and hot-reloading
   - Production stage optimized for Cloud Run deployment
   - Include proper base images (Python 3.9+)

2. Implement docker-compose.yml for local development:
   - Configure FastAPI service with volume mounts for code changes
   - Add supporting services (Redis, mock Firebase emulator)
   - Set up networking between containers
   - Configure environment-specific variables

3. Create .dockerignore file:
   - Exclude unnecessary files (venv, __pycache__, .git)
   - Optimize build context size and speed

4. Implement environment configuration management:
   - Create .env.example template file
   - Develop environment variable loading mechanism
   - Configure separate environments (dev, test, prod)
   - Implement secrets management strategy

5. Set up Cloud Run deployment configuration:
   - Create cloud-run-config.yaml for deployment settings
   - Configure memory, CPU, and scaling parameters
   - Set up environment variable management for Cloud Run
   - Implement health check configuration

6. Optimize Docker image:
   - Implement layer caching strategies
   - Minimize image size using multi-stage builds
   - Configure proper dependency installation
   - Set up non-root user for security

7. Configure CI/CD pipeline integration:
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow for Docker build and push
   - Implement automated testing in containerized environment
   - Configure Cloud Run deployment steps

8. Document Docker usage:
   - Create README section for local development setup
   - Document environment configuration requirements
   - Include troubleshooting guide for common Docker issues

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify local development environment:
   - Run `docker-compose up` and confirm all services start correctly
   - Make code changes and verify hot-reloading functionality
   - Test API endpoints through the containerized application
   - Verify environment variables are properly loaded

2. Test production Docker build:
   - Build production image with `docker build --target production .`
   - Run container locally with production settings
   - Verify application starts correctly with production configurations
   - Confirm optimized image size and performance

3. Validate environment configuration:
   - Test application with different environment settings
   - Verify proper fallback behavior for missing variables
   - Confirm secrets are properly handled and not exposed

4. Test Cloud Run deployment configuration:
   - Perform dry-run deployment to verify configuration
   - Test scaling behavior with simulated load
   - Verify health check endpoint responds correctly
   - Confirm environment variables are properly set in Cloud Run

5. Security testing:
   - Scan Docker image for vulnerabilities
   - Verify non-root user is properly configured
   - Check for exposed secrets or sensitive information

6. Integration testing:
   - Verify Docker setup works with CI/CD pipeline
   - Test automated build and deployment process
   - Confirm proper versioning of Docker images

7. Performance testing:
   - Measure container startup time
   - Test application performance in containerized environment
   - Verify resource constraints are properly handled
